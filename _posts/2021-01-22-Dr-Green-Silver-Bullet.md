Dr. Megan Green, Alderwoman ward 15: Ya know, I would say that we have what Ive called before “silver bullet project syndrome”. Every snake oil salesman that seems to come into town telling us that they have a bridge in Brooklyn that they have to sell us, we seem to fall for.

I think we can do better than that and we should go do better than that. I think we would be having a different conversation if there was any efficacy to show that this works, but there's really not.

I will just close by saying that this is a reactionary approach to public safety, what we need to be investing in is crime deterrence. We may get lucky and catch someone after the fact that has committed a crime, but that does not go back and erase the crime that was committed. 

It does not build trust. The reason we do not have witnesses coming forward who sees crime is because of lack of trust with our government, lack of trust with police, lack of trust with our judicial system. Until we address those issues of trust, we are not going to see a decrease in our crime.

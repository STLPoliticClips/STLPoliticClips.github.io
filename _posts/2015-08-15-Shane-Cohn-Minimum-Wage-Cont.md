Shane Cohn, Alderman ward 25: This debate has been going on for almost 80 years at this point in time and actually one of the things that was brought to my attention via Social Media yesterday was a meme actually. It was “remember when FDR, President FDR, who is the President that was responsible for helping push the minimum wage initially, said ‘and a minimum wage shall be established to give teens entry level jobs so that they can have some spending cash and get work experience? Do we remember when FDR said that? No.”

We don't remember when FDR said that. FDR never said that. What FDR, what Franklin Delano Roosevel our President who initially passed minimum wage 80 years ago said was “no business which depends for existence on paying less than living wages to its workers has any right to continue in this country. By living wages, I mean more than a bare subsistence level, I mean the wages of a decent living.” That is what the President mentioned when he passed the minimum wage 80 years ago, and that’s what we’re here discussing today in this moment.

We are not talking about paying people below their value, we are talking about giving people a wage that they earn. We are not giving people money, they are earning money. They need to be earning a wage that they can provide not only for families, but for themselves. $7.65/hr is not enough to survive. It is not enough to survive as an individual, let alone supporting a family.

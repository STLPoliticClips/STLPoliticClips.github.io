Joe Vollmer, Alderman ward 10: Just seeing what I see on a daily basis. I would say that keeping our meetings virtual, to ensure safety, and then give us a summer to see what happens and then to come back and that would be the safest route, I believe, with no doubt in anyone's mind. Especially if there's mold and the heat of -- well--, there's no air conditioning in that area, if there was mold. If you want to eliminate any, that is just my opinion, any chance of anyone contracting anything with only five weeks, I would never want to rush to judgment and injure someone. 

But that's just my opinion, sir.

Terry Kennedy, Board of Alderman Clerk: I will raise one issue that several of them did raise more than several, there is the smell of mold in one section of the office. That is pretty strong. At times, we did have facilities come in and look at it and they confirm that there is mold in the piping or in the air ducts. that needs to be addressed. And you know, mold causes respiratory problems of which COVID is that type also has respiratory issues. So that needs to be addressed as well. And we're going back to facilities to see how soon that could happen. It is really very strong in the summertime when things heat up, not as badly in the winter, when you're when it's cold outside.

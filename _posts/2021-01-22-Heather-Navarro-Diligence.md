Heather Navarro, Alderwoman ward 28: I think we have surveillance used to suppress all throughout history. I think the notion that simply because Mr. McNutt showed up at a hearing and said he’s a good guy and he’s got a good company, that that should be the end of our due diligence. This is a private company that has one sole member, that’s its founder.

I have been to the website, it’s a series of short videos where he answers these questions about ‘what about this’ ‘is this footage admissible in court?’ and it’s simply him. He references no experts, no lawyers, no data. 

I just think if we’re going to consider waiving our citizen’s Constitutional rights to privacy, we need to be doing a little bit more due diligence. This is not it.

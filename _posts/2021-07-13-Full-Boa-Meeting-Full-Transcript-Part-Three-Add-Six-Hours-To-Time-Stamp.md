alderman from the fifth.

James Page, 5th ward Alderman  05:21
Thank you, Mr. President, and members of the board. I'd like to introduce amendment number nine that addresses Senior Services.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  05:35
motion. I'll second. It's been moved. alderman from the other than from the fifth. Can you put that in the form of emotion? 

James Page, 5th ward Alderman  05:44
Yes, I'd be happy to. As President, I seek federal support and I move that we adopt amendment number nine Senior Services. 

Joe Vaccaro, 23rd ward Alderman  05:56
Again, I second that 

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  05:58
Been moved by the alderman from the fifth second button from the 23rd. alderman from the fifth please continue, if you will go through this entire amendment and read it into record. That'd be good.

James Page, 5th ward Alderman  06:12
 Yes, I'd be happy to. Mr. President, members of the board this amendment deals specifically with moving Senior Services and direct care. This is a technical adjustment or a technical fix only. It would it involves moving funding to the Department of Human Human Services and from the Community Development Administration. DHS, not CDA has the capacity to administer direct support care workers and senior services. And in the attached to the overview, it there is a section that gives all of the adjustments that to and from the language to be struck the language to be substituted and the numerical values that apply in the movement of these funds. With that quick overview, I would be happy to entertain questions or discussion. alderman. All the ones from the 20th recognized.

Christine Ingrassia, 6th ward Alderwoman  07:31
Thank you, Mr. President. I rose my hand erroneously Oh, initially, just kind of wanting a summary of it of what you know, when it appeared that we were moving far without fully describing what was going on. So I was just looking for a step. Oh, God. Okay. clarification, Mr. President, that's all I have.

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  07:54
Okay, not not a problem. All the way from the 22nd. Yes, thank you, Mr. President, members of board with the auditor from the fifth year for question, please hold them from the fifth year the question and development from 22nd blandly. Thank you, alderman from the fifth. I just want to make sure I'm clear seems like it's pretty simple and benign what you're doing. Um, but are we adding not subtracting anything? You know, what all the paper and going back and forth on the computer is gets a little confusing. So are we just taking the 20 tell me exactly how much money we take in from CDA to put it to help new services, which I think is a great idea, by the way.

James Page, 5th ward Alderman  08:35
Right? Well, it's a it's essentially a net zero amendment. What what's happening is that we're moving funding and I will tell you the exact amounts in section three of the board bill, we are moving 26,386,300 Ah, let me get this right $26,386,370 into the Department of Human Services. And in that's in Section three, and in Section seven. We are moving a total of $18,500,000 of Coronavirus recovery funds into CDA. So, the total amount of money going into Department of Human Services and this is a total after all the adjustments is $38,828,368.20 on my dad Then the total amount going into CDA is reduced. And that total is 18,500,000. And the difference is that we are moving the money for senior services and direct care. From CDA, which is not equipped to deal with these services into the Department of Human Services. I hope that clarifies it a little.

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  10:32
Just a little bit is what I'm trying to do all the minutes. I'm trying to follow the exhibit. So in the exhibit I'm looking at it has committee Development Agency, block, and it says $22 million and always fixing something. Because if I follow exhibit, and you're taking out 22 million, that's not what's showing in exhibit exhibit is showing only 22 million.

James Page, 5th ward Alderman  11:06
Now, what now, what section of the exhibit So Mark can exhibit one?

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  11:15
Yeah, if you go to exhibit one, all the way at the tail end of the board bill. It has the breakout of the different departments, which is you know, allocated money, and CDA all is being allocated only 22 million.

James Page, 5th ward Alderman  11:35
Now, if if you're at the last table, in the package, okay. Okay. It shows $22 million being struck, and a new total of 18 facts. Is that what you're looking at? No, I was actually. I was actually this is, this table is listed as exhibit one.

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  12:05
Right, the original board bill to committee stuff as amended. If we look at that exhibit, currently it shows 22 million for CDA.

James Page, 5th ward Alderman  12:17
And that's correct. With the amendment, that amount gets reduced to 18. Five.

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  12:25
Okay, so we've taken out the word support. Okay, members foundation. Okay. Okay. So you took that out of that? Yeah, because the rest of it was already in. Okay. Um, which I gotcha. Okay, thank you, alderman. I hope that makes sense. I was trying to follow you table by table. Um, which I got it. Thank you, sir. Okay. Thank you.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  12:51
Alderwoman. From the 14th. All the one from the 14th. Okay, any further discussion, Any further discussion? All the men from the fifth. You recognize that close. 

James Page, 5th ward Alderman  13:17
Thank you, Mr. President, members of the board. I asked the board's favorable support on amendment number nine. And I move that we adopt say an amendment number nine. It's been moved by on from fifth seconded by alderman between third that we adopt amendment number nine VOTE BEING TAKEN. All in favor signify by saying aye. Aye. Hi, pose. Motion carries. Any further amendments in further minutes, all the one from the sixth.

Christine Ingrassia, 6th ward Alderwoman  13:52
Thank you, Mr. President. You should have in your folders amendment 19. To board bill to committee substitute as amended for behavioral health providers. So I am looking to increase the amount of funding from $2,250,000 to $5 million for the cops and clinicians program. So we have been able to address a number of calls for service that typically get routed to the police in a very short time, so between February and July of this year. Two Three or 323 colors have been diverted to the beaver health response team since the start of this service. Out of those calls, 236 of them or approximately 73% have not been linked with behavioral behavioral health services. At the time of the 911 call, in 59% of those calls, were not requiring any police or MMS response. And so this increase of $2.5 million will allow the program to continue. It was funded one year under the former administration, and increase the capacity to a 24 hour seven day a week program. And then allow for a mostly civilian response instead of having the police or emfs be involved when it's not necessary that they do. And I'm happy to take questions from colleagues on this.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  15:48
Thank you. Any further discussion, all of them from the 22nd?

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  15:55
But thank you, Mr. President and board. Sorry, I'm trying to stretch us to midnight. But I would ask you if the hard won from the six with your questions,

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  16:03
I'll learn from the six with you on the question until alderman from the 22nd.

Dan Guenther, Alderman ward 9  16:11
point on the wire real quick. I'm sorry. 

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  16:13
Please state your point of order. 

Dan Guenther, Alderman ward 9  16:15
I'm sorry. I didn't hear the motion on the amendment and the second.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  16:22
For the for the amendment number 19. She has not she she she was talking about it and never got around to making the motion.

Dan Guenther, Alderman ward 9  16:33
So your motion in a second?

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  16:35
No, there wasn't a motion and a second. She was you have a note here cuz he was she was going on long discussion and didn't get it. All one from the six.

Christine Ingrassia, 6th ward Alderwoman  16:49
Thank you, Mr. President for allowing me that discretion. It's been a long day. I moved that we introduced amendment 19 to board bill.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  17:03
But the alderman for the night didn't get passed. Then move on all the one for the six second bound for the ninth hour back on track.

Christine Ingrassia, 6th ward Alderwoman  17:15
alderman from the old one from the sixth of the year, the question until alderman from the 22nd. A Well,

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  17:22
thank you Alderwoman. I'm definitely a proponent of cops and condition program. But I was wondering, you know, when I think about I think about domestic calls, oftentimes, and we're really struggling in my ward with prostitution. Matter of fact, this past Sunday, I experienced someone just watching a while I'm sitting on the porch with a cup of coffee. Obviously she was strung out and she's one of the local prostitutes, sex workers from my neighborhood. Could we call in with that program worked with people like that? Are they basically just for more domestic calls? 

Christine Ingrassia, 6th ward Alderwoman  18:03
That's a great question. Alderman. Thank you so much for asking it. I think the increased funding will allow the breadth of calls for service that social workers are responding to, to be able to address situations like that. I mean, domestic calls, sometimes end up needing the police and calls for a think prostitution is is a different realm of those calls. I think that we can all agree that even though prostitution might be of concern the way that it's currently operating, that if we have interventionists to interact with the population of folks who who might need to call for service, that's not just the police department, that we can better address issues like that, that pop up. And I do have those similar issues to you in my ward as well.

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  19:07
So basically, what you're saying is, we need a separate program to deal with that and not necessarily the cops and clinicians program. I want to make sure I'm clear with what you said.

Christine Ingrassia, 6th ward Alderwoman  19:18
Thank you for clarifying. No, I think that the the cops and clinicians program can address it by depending on the calls that come into 911 having appropriate folks who can respond to the situation I mean, if it's a situation of violence, and we're someone's life is in danger, then we probably want the police to respond but if it's um, I don't want to say simple because that's work is not simple. But if it's just a simple case of someone needing assistance that the they're being they have More than it is with increased funding. Okay. Thank you. Appreciate it. You're welcome.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  20:07
Thank you. Any further discussion in further discussion? All the woman from the six year recognized?

Cara Spencer, Alderwoman ward 20  20:15
President I'm sorry, my hands raised.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  20:18
Sorry about that. All wrong from the 20th.

Christine Ingrassia, 6th ward Alderwoman  20:22
Thank you, Mr. President, members of the board. You know, frankly speaking, it's hard for me to vote on this, on this amendment on any amendment on this and tire package? Well, there has certainly been a lot of work. And I want to thank my colleagues who were invited to be part of the planning process who have clearly put in some hours of work here. My colleague from the ninth and ninth mentioned that many of you have been on zoom since eight. I know many of you have been but many of us have not. And the process has taken input, I believe, taking input and informing people and alderman based on political alignments why I just think it's wrong. So here we are six hours in and some of us, many of us are just now learning about amendments, very large amendments. Just now, having never received answers to very simple questions that I myself asked. Last week, continue to ask today. And, you know, just now getting information from the administration, four hours into a hearing, which is just frankly, really unorganized and inappropriate and really disappointing. We have known about this funding for so many months now. And here we are at the 13th hour, you know, just trying to ramp this up for for the summer break. And many of us are just really, really, really uninformed about what's going on here. This entire process, in my opinion has been grossly disappointing. We have loaded public input that is included a whopping 1% of our residents. And the village developed a hodgepodge of items that we want to fund many of which most of which are very, very good programs, and very good initiatives. And a hodgepodge is not anything outside of what you'd expect. In fact, it's all you can expect from a framework, a process that has been so underwhelming, a framework that, frankly, doesn't exist. This is, quite frankly, an unprecedented amount of money, a once in a century opportunity and we cannot afford to squander it. And we should not be deciding on amendments as large as $5 million. on just a few minutes of conversation without really I mean, no matter how good the program is, or how good all these things are, we are asking the wrong questions. We're asking what projects do we want to fund when we should be asking? What do we want these funds to accomplish? in a broad sense, in a grand sense? And what metrics are we going to use to mark our success? How do we want these funds to change the trajectory of our city, and we should be committing ourselves every time we allocate these funds to any any project, two measures that we are going to use to measure our success and report back to the general public. I believe the city needs to fund and focus these funds in a very broad sense, on the very serious problems that result in the city receiving such an unprecedent enormous federal package to begin with our digging building stock, our poverty and the stagnation of our city's general economy are what drove the enormity of our package and failing to make headway on these indicators will result in us coming back here 50 or 100 years from now with the same stuff. So you know, I'm just speaking out on this particular amendment. Because, you know, if this is a problem with the entire, the entire process, and I don't know how long we're gonna be here today, I have a 430, I have a 530 and a seven, you know, I'm happy to cancel those as we go. But you know, at the same time, you know, to be learning about these today, even though they're in the drive, I just think is a real missed opportunity to have articulated and developed a vision, a broader vision for what it is that we want to accomplish. So for example, the cops and clinicians, I think this is a great program. We all think this is a great problem. For the most part, I shouldn't speak for everyone here but but the reality is, we should have be able to measure success with what we're going to be putting in $5 million. let's commit to having a successful cops and conditions program that reduces the number of 911 calls or reduces XY and Z but instead, we're just filling in buckets. And I really am very disappointed in how this process has played out. very disappointed in the lack of cohesive, collaborative communicative process throughout this entire consideration. Not from necessarily everyone here involved but we really our city deserves more so as we move into the second tier, and the second process here, I would just like to make sure that out that that those concerns This, this criticism of the process is long. And hopefully we can all do better going into the next phases. Thank you. Again, it's just hard to vote on these amendments. I know that some of these things that this program is very good, but what are we going to get specifically out of $5? million? How do we come up with those figures? Where are we going with us? And again, this is the first time many of us today during this process, you know, it's it's just the first time many of us are learning about a lot of this.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  25:28
Thank you so much. Alderwoman. And, you know, for the record, that's been some of the frustrations of the committee members in trying to get information, we have requested information that we still have not received. So. But thank you for underscoring that. All the one from the first. 

Sharon Tyus, 1st ward Alderwoman  25:49
Thank you, Mr. President, members of the board at the 

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  25:51
Alderwoman from the sixth yield, along from six, we have a question into the all the one from the first. 

Christine Ingrassia, 6th ward Alderwoman  25:57
I will,  thank you. 

Sharon Tyus, 1st ward Alderwoman  26:00
Hello, there, what time is it? Hell, 435 o'clock. I just cancel the 430. Okay,

Christine Ingrassia, 6th ward Alderwoman  26:10
I just canceled my appointment to get my gray hairs died. So it's late in the day,

Sharon Tyus, 1st ward Alderwoman  26:15
my mom's house and the plumber has the water off, and the electrician is someplace. And so we're I'm having fun. Okay, but okay. Um, this $14,000,500. So I'm really looking at the exhibit, it says the Department of Health is scratch 3250 2,000,250. And it went to 5 million. So and that says behavioral health providers. So is that specifically what that an additional 2.25 is going to go to? Yes, yes. So

Christine Ingrassia, 6th ward Alderwoman  26:47
the original allocation in the committee substitute as amended was 2.5 million. And I'm asking that we increase it by an additional 2.5 million.

Sharon Tyus, 1st ward Alderwoman  26:56
Okay. And then it says Department of Health goes from 3,250,000 to 14,000,500. So that includes that two, to five. Oh, and some other things. Right? Is that correct?

Christine Ingrassia, 6th ward Alderwoman  27:11
It does? Yes.

Sharon Tyus, 1st ward Alderwoman  27:12
And so is this other amendments that we've done? Or is this something entirely different? Do we know how much the Department of Health is getting totally with things that we've done around? Or is that something we're gonna have to look at when we get to the end of this whole debate,

Christine Ingrassia, 6th ward Alderwoman  27:30
I think we'll have to look at it at the end of the debate, because I wasn't aware of all of the amendments that would be offered. And so, for example, the Alderwoman, from the 26, just offered an amendment that we approved, that also impacts the Department of Health. And so these are not. It's a complicated bill, these are not completely clean amendments, and I'm happy to entertain a friendly amendment or work on an amendment while we talk about something else to make sure that the total amount gets cut out. If that's something of importance to you.

Sharon Tyus, 1st ward Alderwoman  28:08
Well, I was just thought it is important to me, because our bills gonna be incorrect, you are trying to total it. But if we don't total, all the other things that affect the health department, then it's not going to be a correct bill. At some point, I think we're going to have to take a break something I'm as a chair, I do sometimes half an hour, 45 minutes, or whatever we need, we're gonna do some kind of break to add up all of this unless we get somebody sitting down to the side. And all of these changes, because our build is going to be a mess. It's not going to be anything that's comprehensive or even understandable. And so that's why I was wondering if you this, this 14, five was was total, but it's just what you were doing. Right,

Christine Ingrassia, 6th ward Alderwoman  28:51
separate? Yeah, thank you for bringing it to my attention. It's something I didn't consider. But I see the value in making sure we have a clean copy of the bill to go to engrossment. I don't know if alderman from the seventh is on any longer, but I'm sure he would appreciate receiving a bill that isn't confusing to the

Sharon Tyus, 1st ward Alderwoman  29:17
committee. As the former chair of rules. Let me tell you, it makes a difference. Okay,

Christine Ingrassia, 6th ward Alderwoman  29:22
I say that. Yes. Yes.

Sharon Tyus, 1st ward Alderwoman  29:25
Um, so what do you envision this additional? Tip 1011, whatever amount, what do you envision that the Department of Health will will be doing with this additional 1000s 10s of 1000s of I'm just gonna use 10,000. Because I, at this point, I'm like, I can't figure out how much additionally is going to be let's just say 10,000 10 million more dollars. What are we going to do with that?

Christine Ingrassia, 6th ward Alderwoman  29:52
Okay, well, if it's helpful to you,  It's an increase of 2.25. That's in the committee substitute as amended to $5 million to do further work with BHR, which is the behavioral response team to add additional diversion, to open up the program to be operating 24 hours a day, seven days a week, that's not something we're doing right now. And to increase the civilian experts that are responding to calls for service, I will say with the initial $1.4 million that was allocated to the program, I'm pretty impressed with the results. So far. They seem on track with other diversion 911 calls that I've seen happening in other cities. And so I think because of the efficacy that's been indicated in what we're doing, so far, this program deserves some additional funding to make it more comprehensive.

Sharon Tyus, 1st ward Alderwoman  30:54
Oh, I'm a big fan of the police. They shown they can't handle when there are problems other than having to shoot first and ask questions later. Okay. So when there's mental health involved, they've not done a good job across the United States. So I'm an advocate of that. My, I guess my further concern, though, would be so when we give all this money, and we get this program going, what happens when we don't have this funds anymore? Then what happens?

Christine Ingrassia, 6th ward Alderwoman  31:24
I think that's a great point, one of the allowed expenses under ARPA funding is to pilot programs to determine their efficacy and then allow the city at some point to determine whether or not it's something that we can move forward doing. And with the recent effort in new conversations about our public safety budget, I feel confident that if this is something that's working well for both the police department and residents, that it would make no sense for us not to fund something like this in our budget.

Sharon Tyus, 1st ward Alderwoman  32:08
You said it will make sense for for us to continue to fund something like this. I'm sorry to hear that.

Christine Ingrassia, 6th ward Alderwoman  32:13
Yes, to continue to fund programs like this.  And regardless of what you think about the police. I think that the way that police are hired and trained right now, we're giving the police department and unfair job, their job is to protect us from the most violent criminal offenders. And I think even that can be done differently. But the number of calls the percentage of calls that 911 and the police have to deal with every single day that don't really have to do with ordinance violations. I think they're very similar calls to what alderman get sometimes like, I've been asked to remove a pokey stop. In front of someone's house, I've been asked to make someone's neighbor's dog stop giving them a dirty look, when they walked out the door like there are there are people there are social workers, there are mediators, there are folks who are trained to do this work without having police intervention. And I think this is a smart way to move forward in terms of continuing to determine how we can implement different structures instead of 9110.

Sharon Tyus, 1st ward Alderwoman  33:27
So again, let me emphasize I used to be a pro pro pro police person didn't believe the police could ever lie about things. Unfortunately, I became a public defender, my first three cases prove that they were not just making mistakes, but lying. But in these last four years under Captain Mueller, and me being in the fifth district, I don't even believe the police exist, at least not for the first war, even though at least right around the corner, we never see him. But every time I go to that central corridor, I can go to subway there and go to Maryland and up there they sit. But under Captain Miller, he if I could go back and take that I was the sponsor of the bill that gave the police the $66,000 raise, I would take it all back because they do absolutely nothing in the first Ward as it relates to the fifth district. And I would also like to say that we've been promised for years and years that we were going to go back to splitting the EU, we're going to split the six districts up and make sure that we made that a smaller thing and that first we talked about going back to nine then we talked about at least going back to seven so that we could have some community policing. And so, um, that hasn't happened and that was a promise for four years under the prior administration. So I am not a happy camper with the police now because we don't get any so anything that takes anything out of their hand so that we could do something else. You is a great thing for me, you know, the I do. And I think it's also a win win situation because they're just not trying to do mental health. And it is I don't think it's unfair. I think it starts from the top when you teach people to shoot to kill, and my family is military, and they're not taught that way. I think that that is a horrible big mistake. And, yes, we're holding the police accountable. But it should have started from the top from the captains, and from the white shirts who are doing this thing. So anything that gets that out of their hands, and gives them some assistance, because I think they go into a mode of fight and everything is a adversarial and sometimes a police call when I was growing up was help, it wasn't adversarial. And the police that I grew up with, they were opposite friendly. And that's when you went to for help. And I think at some point over the time, it's changed. So anything that will do this, that will clean it, clean it up and make sure that we're addressing that people have mental health issues, which they've always had. And we didn't always kill them the way we do it now. So the police did a different job. To me, that's just been my experience when people talk about their bad experiences with police officers up until up to Captain Miller and I really didn't have any. He's been a horrible example. But other than that, we've had really good policing. And I've been doing this for a lot of years. And even though I know that I found out the police don't always tell the truth, I've always thought that 90% of them were trying to do the right thing. There's a 10%, that got a problem. And I wish the 90% wouldn't cover for them. And I would wish that the organization wouldn't cover for them. But addressing mental health, not only for the police, but we need to be doing that on a city wide and nationwide basis is that making mental health not be in the closet for people not to be scared to so they have a problem. And for instead of us shooting people because we've actually had a police officer kill somebody up in the second Ward that I think that guy had some mental problems. And I still remember that back in 2013. When I came here, that still haunts me, he had a knife, and everybody in the neighborhood knew him. And I think we could have handled that an entirely different. So that would be exactly the situation I would love to see a sin help workers out and to deal with him in a compassionate way instead of him have been just another fatality that was unnecessary. So I am supportive. I just wanted to hear more about it. I am in agreement still with people to say it's a lot of stuff we just didn't know. And this is this should be an inclusive body. It shouldn't be just a few people who know what's going on. And so I'm still going to support him. But I'm still greatly disappointed about the lack of inclusion. Thank you for that compliment. I

Christine Ingrassia, 6th ward Alderwoman  37:44
also wanted to make sure that you know that I don't introduce amendments or support amendments that I am not supportive of. And so I think there's a lot of accusations that all of these amendments from some of us are coming directly from the mayor's office, but I like have my own mind and make my own decisions and don't disagree that maybe there should have been some more comprehensive engagement with more alderman. And that's a lesson learned for the mayor's office. But yeah, I guess don't assume,

Sharon Tyus, 1st ward Alderwoman  38:20
oh, I've had a lot of conversations. But this is just a big chunk of money for me not to believe that that came from someplace else. Usually when alderman are doing something, it's a smaller amount. So my spidey senses says and, and even if I don't like the way somebody did something, if it's something correct, I have my own mind, and I'll still support it anyway. But that don't mean I won't tell you don't do that anymore. Okay. That's not a good thing. But I still support the concept. Okay. And what came from you or the mayor, I agree with what you're trying

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  38:50
to do. Alright. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Alderwoman. And it's been all the ones from the 14th. Yes, well, the Alderwoman. For the six ask your question. All one from the six will yield a question until all the one from the 14 I will.

Carol Howard, 14th ward Alderwoman  39:10
This is sort of a nuts and bolts. Did you mean to double the amount that was allocated for behavioral health providers? Yes, I

Christine Ingrassia, 6th ward Alderwoman  39:19
think if we want to increase the funding for it, that makes sense. But if we are going to increase the funding for it, so $1.4 million dollars was allocated last year. So between February 2021. And this is a year's worth of funding. If we want to make this more comprehensive, make it 24 hours a day, seven days a week and a part time project for the city. We need the funding to do that and so this amendment will allow for that to happen.

Carol Howard, 14th ward Alderwoman  39:52
Okay, well, this is like I said the nuts and bolts. You You're talking about you originally there was allocated 2,000,250 $1,000 and you've according to your amendment here that I have in front of me, you have $5 million. That's more than doubling it. And I just was wondering if that was what you meant to do, or did you only want to allocate $4.5 million?

Christine Ingrassia, 6th ward Alderwoman  40:19
No. 5 million to make sure that we can be comprehensive in our bridge and is okay. Yeah.

Carol Howard, 14th ward Alderwoman  40:25
Okay, then, I guess what? So the total offer to the Department of Health would then be 16 to 50. No, I'm sorry. That's wrong. 1414.

Christine Ingrassia, 6th ward Alderwoman  40:44
Again, I think and I apologize, I should have been more thoughtful when I was drafting amendments, that the totals don't necessarily make sense based on other amendments that have been offered. So.

Carol Howard, 14th ward Alderwoman  41:03
Yeah, I I just was wanting to know, because you were saying you doubled it, and it's more than doubled. And I just want to make sure that that's that the 5 million was what you meant not 4.5 million. Yes. Okay. Okay. Well, I don't I'm not sure if the numbers add up. I can't do that. The all those zeros in my head sometimes, but I know you can drop them off. But anyway, it'll be okay. All right. That's all I had. Thank you.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  41:32
All right. Thank you. It's been moved by Alderwoman. from six seconded by the owner of the night that we adopt amendment number 19. VOTE BEING TAKEN All in favor signify by saying aye. Aye. Motion carries. Please make note of anything further, and then further. alderman from the 21st.

John Collins-Muhammad, 21st Alderman  43:07
Thank you, Mr. President, amendment number, a member number 11. is the exact same amendment that we were debating or Yeah, the exact same member we were debating earlier. In a session about three hours ago. It clarifies the language for the targeted cash assistance program for residents in the city of St. Louis. I know we have we had a lot of debate on it. We reached a compromise and a agreement. And we are all on board. I believe it should be in the Google Drive, which I was told it was by the clerk. If there are any questions from members of the committee, I can take them. But this will be a great round for the city of St. Louis. And I want to thank you, Mr. President, for working on this amendment with me. And I think the mayor's office as well for being open to negotiations, and being willing to work with the Board of Aldermen as deliberate on how to best serve the citizens of St. Louis.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  44:07
You're welcome. All the woman from the 13th your hands up first.

Anne Schweitzer, 13th Ward Alderwoman  44:14
Thank you so much. Um, I have a question is, I'm not sure if I should ask it to the sponsor or just in general, isn't amendment number 11. No different I heard it was a compromise but amendment number 11 was the name of the other. I guess I should I sponsor Well, the alderman for the 21st question.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  44:34
They think

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  44:36
good is that we kept the amendment because I was the original sponsor of the amendment. we clarify the language we chew the amendment back. When we Judy amendment back, I was able to edit it and we work it in now. I'm introduced that minutes and put it back before us again. If you if you look at the amendment, it clarifies what it is and you will see the changes in it. That's reflective On both sides more.

Dr. Megan Green, 15th ward Alderwoman  45:02
Great. So it's a it's a, it's a new amendment with the same number. Yes. Remember that was before us before it's a new it's a new amendment, same number. Okay.

Heather Navarro, 28th ward Alderwoman  45:10
Thank you. I won't read it.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  45:16
Any further discussion? alderman from the ninth?

Dan Guenther, Alderman ward 9  45:24
Yeah, thank you, Mr. President. So I just want to stand in support of amendment number 11, to board bill to come a substitute. And thank the aldermen from the 21st. As I've been reading through it here, if you all remember three hours ago, our debate and a lot of the questions that were brought, it seems to include some of it seems to include what everyone was seem to agree on during the last time. But if the alderman from the 21st would yield for just a couple questions, I'd appreciate it.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  46:05
Okay. All of them from 21st. We yield the question to alderman from the night. Yes, Mr. President, please proceed.

Dan Guenther, Alderman ward 9  46:15
Thank you all for the 21st. So my first question was in the book, can you hear me? Yes. Okay. Um, and one of the earlier versions here. In the charts, we had 5 million going to the office of the treasurer. But then we also had there was an additional amount that was going towards the financial literacy part. And I don't see that can you let me know how that was? How that was negotiated.

John Collins-Muhammad, 21st Alderman  46:50
Thank you. Thank you, alderman. So I did talk with the with him or his office, I shared with her my concerns about an additional $500,000 going to the treasurer to operate a literacy program. And it was agreed with me and her, then it is somewhat unnecessary. And it's a burden to make people take a financial literacy course, for $500 doing a pandemic, if I'm struggling to pay my bills, and I'm trying to get $500 from the city of St. Louis, you want me to sit in a, you know, what, our class two hour class three hour class? We don't know. Because it has not been set up in other cities that we modeled this idea and policy afterwards. It's not, it's not inclusive, and no cities that we are trying to mimic with this is just not it's just not appropriate at this time. And the dimmers office also agreed. So does the president's office. And I believe so do a member, so do a number of our members of the board.

Dan Guenther, Alderman ward 9  47:54
Okay, thank you. Yeah, that was one of the things I see. Other thing I'm looking through here is kind of the there was a obviously during our last discussion, there was a lot of questions whether Department of Human Services versus the treasurer's office here. And so when I'm looking at the bold part, the treasurer shall be responsible for implementing the program. Then you go on to say, under the administrative oversight, the Director of the Department of Human Services, negotiate, execute. So he explained that the the compromise between the department, Human Services and treasurer's office kind of how that works out.

John Collins-Muhammad, 21st Alderman  48:35
Sure, automate the exact same thing that I talked about about two or three hours ago, the department Human Services will be the parent agency responsible for its implementation, its operations in a church where we'll work in conjunction, and under the supervision of the Director of Human Service to implement the program that was also agreed upon by the treasurer after Sure. I mean, Madam Mayor, I'm sorry, mom, Mayor and her administration after I shared my concerns, so the treasurer will play a role with the implementation of this program, but it will be under the leadership and under the oversight of the Department of Human Services, who is responsible for the social welfare in the social resources of our citizens here in St. Louis.

Dan Guenther, Alderman ward 9  49:22
I thank you so much, alderman. Very good. Thank you. And then my final thing here, and this is kind of tied into the last amendments discussion, as the Alderwoman from the first was mentioning about as we're making changes to amendments, updating kind of totals on dollar amounts. So I think this is going to be something that I guess either the alderman from the seventh is the new rules Chairman or Mr. Clerk, we had to figure out but one of the other things I want to point out here in this first paragraph, it says the director of the Department of Human Services His or her designees are hereby authorized. I just want to point out as we go through all of this bill, that we agreed that all of our pronouns will be they, them. So um, so that was just a thing that I think we need to add to what the Alderwoman from the first brought up in the last discussion about updating, and again, probably for the clerk or the press, or the chair of the rules. So that thank you so much. I'm on a listen to the rest of the questions. I thank you for answering. And thank you, Mr. President.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  50:32
Thank you. Thank you. Yeah, so after we complete, you know, our amendments today, the clerk and staff will incorporate all of the changes and deliver those change the final bill to to, to the chairman rules, so that rules can overlook it and ensure that everything's in place. All these things that we're doing today will be incorporated in the final bill. All within 20 seconds. Thank you, Mr. President. I wasn't bored. Somehow I

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  51:12
got lost, I'm trying to look for. I'm looking at amendment number 11 is a board bill took many subject as amended. And it's but it looks like a newer version. And it's bold. So I noticed a new version, but it it shouldn't just be an amendment to the amendment. I'm trying to follow when

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  51:40
they withdrew their original amendment, so it essentially didn't exist any pending further. So, um, so I just put, um, so. So this one that we have before us is the new amendment number 11. Okay, with the clerk and just rewrote it, rewrote the amendment number 11. With the final ever, all the final changes and amendment number one,

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  52:18
man, when I say pass on board bills, like making sausage, there's a lot of sausage making going on today. This kind of come to earth with the alderman from 21st, year

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  52:32
Alderwoman. From 21st. We have the question 22nd make? Sure Sure.

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  52:39
Ottoman, I still don't have a full understanding of why the treasurer's office will be implementing this program. It says bait basically what this sounds like to me is the money is going to help the Human Services and they're going to just subcontract out to the treasurer's office. So it's the same soup warmed over. I mean, there's nothing really changed in here. Except What? Tell me what has changed. 

John Collins-Muhammad, 21st Alderman  53:10
Thank you ultimate. So it's not a subcontract. The treasurer's office is not responsible for its implementation. It is the department Human Services, the treasurer's office that will play a role in helping this program rolled out because it's the person that's going to be writing the checks to to people who are probably Human Services approved. That's what they're doing. They're writing the check. The department Human Services is responsible for his eligibility requirements, processing the applications and approving people to get the funds. Okay, so make sure I heard you clearly you said the trade off is not implementing the program. Is that what you said?

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  53:58
Yes. Okay. So let me read you something because I just want to make sure that I'm on the same Page with the right amendment. So I haven't I'm looking at amendment number 11. To board bill to committee such that as amended. It says in bold, the director of Department of Human Services or her designee are hereby authorized to make, negotiate and execute any and all contracts or other documents on behalf of the City described in exhibit two, related to evaluation and oversight. The Treasurer shall be responsible for implementing the program and dispersing payments according to the process set out in existence to under the administrative oversight of the Director of Human Services the treasurer are her designee are hereby authorized to make negotiate execute any and all contracts or other documents on behalf of the City to expand such funds and to expand such funds on behalf of the city as approved by the Department of Human Services for the purpose Purpose described on exhibit two and in accordance with the procedure described in exhibit two. So I just wanna make sure I'm clear. Did you hear what I read about the treasurer shall be responsible for implementing the program? I did, alderman. But did you also see where it says the treasurer in the program at the direction of the Department of Human Services, that's also in boat, you read it, right? It's also included in that in that mm. Okay, so um, maybe I'm experiencing some cognitive dissonance right now, as far as my, you know, logical processing of information. I can be, you know, the one responsible for, you know, the I could be, oh, have oversight of the money, but you can actually implement the program. Once I release funds to you, you get to implement them, of course, based on what we agree to, I'm guessing. But at the end of the day, the treasurer is the one that's implementing the program, this is a pass through, when we get through talking, this is nothing but a pass through from the healthy human service department to the treasurer's office. Again, I don't understand why the treasurer and I have nothing Personally, I guess the treasurer, don't even know the young man. But I don't understand because I'm talking process and procedure. I don't understand why the treasurer needs to be implementing a program like this, when the treasurer has no dealings with homeless people, or dealing with, you know, the people that the target audience that we're dealing with, but that's just not in the wheelhouse of the treasurer. Now. What is in the wheelhouse of the treasurer is the Office of Financial Empowerment where they teach them how to, you know, to be financially responsible. And I'm a proponent of, you know, if I give you some money, I want to make sure that you're using it in a way that really helps you. And just giving you $500 is not good enough for me. Now, if there was some kind of attachment, that is a requirement, and I hear all the, you know, stuff about oh my god, but these people on a die, and this $500 is gonna make a difference and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, you don't move me with all that hysteria. $500 is not gonna break people. It's just not, I'm not buying into that. We need this, we have no business have proven this as it is, we need to take time to really talk about and walk through how these people are going to benefit. Otherwise, this is a cash giveaway. That's all it is. Let's call it what it is. It's a cash giveaway. I cannot support something like this without some kind of guarantee that the money would be used but intended purposes. Because here's an epitome of a program that we use to help people you're behind on your mortgage, you're behind on your rentals, assistance, guess what? You can be $3,000 behind on your rent. I'm not making a checkout to Breton, right. I'm not making a checkout to Jeffrey boy. I'm making this checkout the Sharon Tyus owner of the property. That way we know as a government entity that we are ensuring that our dollars are going directly to support the individual that is in need. That is the best way that is a better check and balance of what we're doing. Even when it comes to utility assistance. We don't make the checkout to Louis read. We make the checkout to amarin you eat we make the checkout to spire and I'm calling people's first name just for an example not to disrespect their position because yeah, I know where I stand on that.  This is not right on so many levels. I don't know what kind of bonus somebody is gonna get what kind of heroic awards you're gonna get by shoving this through pushing this through. But it's not right. It's not responsible on so many levels. And again, I don't buy into this oh my god the world is gonna end the sky is falling you know people are suffering because we have too many safety nets. Right now. This $500 giveaway is not going to make or break anybody because guess what? The same people the majority of the people that you help with this final check if you gave it to them tomorrow. We're all going to be in the same situation next month. So how many times are we going to reappropriate? These funds. A lot of people that we need to help are mentally ill. And they need those wraparound services, they need somebody to handhold them, they need somebody to uplift them. giving his money away, if you just want to feel good, okay, great.  It reminds me of, and I'm not going to. I don't want to disrespect anybody. But what unnerves me and my neighborhoods so often is we have white people that come in our neighborhood have to clean up projects, from churches and Chesterfield, and different places, and they come in our neighborhood, and they and they feel Oh, I feel so good. I help the people, I help those people in that neighborhood, we made a difference, oh, I can feel good about myself. Because I, as a white person of privilege, have come into this depressed neighborhood. And I help help these people with a clean up project. And I can get a certificate to put on my wall. And the church can be celebrated. But that's not helping. That's not helping for real. When you come in this neighborhood on Martin luther king day, holiday and clean up monolith King status of my neighborhood. I don't need you to come over her one day a year to make yourself feel good. This is a feel good payment. This payment ain't no really helped nobody. It's not. So it's no systemic change. And this is a government giveaway. And it's not right. But we have a chance to maybe make it right. If we set some criteria. And not just give the money away. Let's get a better bang for our buck to know that those we are helping are actually on a journey to help themselves and become more self sufficient. I'm not getting on the train the train. I don't care if they didn't in San Francisco, I don't care if they did this in the Bahamas, I don't care if they did is in wherever I don't care. What I care about is the people in my neighborhood, the people in the city of St. Louis, that were not in abling people that we're empowering people to be better citizens. We can do better than this. We don't have to pass this amendment to this bill or the next amendment to this bill. Because it's not right. We're not solving a problem. Nobody has said anything about data about how many people are out there to make this work. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, alderman. All the one for the 28th.

Heather Navarro, 28th ward Alderwoman  1:03:19
Thank you, Mr. President. I showed up this morning that's about seven hours ago to the meeting in support of this idea of the direct payments and quickly learned that the issue here seem to be whether it was going to be implemented by DHS or by the treasurer's office. And I appreciate the efforts of the various parties involved to try to come together and find a way to work that out. And looking over this language, though, I have to I have to say I find it terribly confusing. So I understand that. So DHS is going to approve the eligibility requirements. And it looks like they are in charge of evaluating the program. But then when we get to the treasurer's office, they're implemented there. The treasurer's office is implementing it. I think it's, and then I have some I have some questions for here. But I think it's really important that everyone is clear on who is doing what if we are going to have two different entities in two different offices, under two different elected officials that are supposed to be working together to implement this program. It's got to be very clear to everyone what those roles are, and who is signing off on what so with the alderman from the 21st yield to a question, please, alderman from the 21st will yield a question until all one from the 28th.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:04:32
Yes, all on from 20th. Please proceed. Great. Thank

Heather Navarro, 28th ward Alderwoman  1:04:36
you. So So alderman, the language that I that I find most confusing here is at the direction of so the treasurer will do certain things at the direction of and then we also have will sign contracts under the administrative oversight of DHS and so I'm what do you what do those terms mean? And let me just break down like the for example site. The treasurer's office will sign contracts under The administration administrative oversight of DHS, does that mean to you that DHS also has to sign off on those contracts? Or that they have that there's an approval mechanism before the treasurer's office would would move through that? Can you explain, you know what those terms mean? And who does what, pursuant to the language that you've added here?

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:05:34
And pollitzer, alderman from 21st. May of last alderman from the 21st. All the one from 20. Please proceed. And if the alderman from 21st when it gets back connected? I'm sure he'll chime back in. But

Heather Navarro, 28th ward Alderwoman  1:05:54
yeah, so I, I would just like to leave it there that I think we need to clean this up. And again, I appreciate the parties coming together to work this out. But if we are going to have two offices under two different elected officials working together, it needs to be very clear who is in charge of making what decisions we've got some of it here, you know, who's in charge of determining eligibility who's in charge of oversight, but implementation? What does that mean? Who has the authority to sign what contracts, what that's going to look like? Because otherwise it is going to just be mired in confusion, which is what we've all been trying to avoid from 10 o'clock this morning. So So thank you, those those are my comments. And if anyone has any other suggestions, or can explain exactly what those terms mean, in terms of who does what, I'm very open.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:06:36
Thank you. All right. Thank you. Alderwoman. alderman foods. 12.

Bill Stephens, 12th ward Alderman  1:06:45
Thank you, Mr. President. I do want to preface this with I've been having connectivity issues. Let me know

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:06:50
Oh. Yeah. Yeah. All my fun 21st. Sounds like he said he got kicked out alderman from 21st. alderman from 12. Continue from 21st is still trying to get back in at least we see his picture now. Hold on one second alderman from 21st year back. 

John Collins-Muhammad, 21st Alderman  1:07:21
I'm here. I'm here.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:07:23
 Alright, perfect. Perfect. Sorry. So um, I don't know if you caught the question from the all the one from the 20th. 

John Collins-Muhammad, 21st Alderman  1:07:31
I did not. 

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:07:32
Oh, I'm from tonight's pose your question?

Heather Navarro, 28th ward Alderwoman  1:07:39
Yes, Yes, it will. So um, I guess in summary, my specific I'm getting some feedback there. So in the language of this amendment, and I just think it's really important that we're clear on who does what, and again, I appreciate everybody coming together and trying to lay this out, clearly. But so for example, where it says under the administrative oversight of the director of DHS, the treasurer, is hereby authorized to make negotiate and execute any and all contracts or other documents. Does that phrase under the administrative oversight mean, that DHS has to also sign off on those contracts has to give some sort of approval? So that was, that was my first question. And then the other one is also about under the direct at the direction of so that's another phrase that, you know, the treasurer does certain things at the direction of DHS. And it's just not clear to me what that means in terms of how that works, who is in charge, who is the ultimate decision maker at the end of at the end of the day. So I this, this lays out who determines eligibility requirements, and DHS is in charge of contracts regarding evaluation and oversight. But then the actual implementation of the program is still very confusing to me with the language that we have in here. So if you have details on who signs off on what, that would be really helpful, and I would just encourage us to clean that up and make it clear in here.

John Collins-Muhammad, 21st Alderman  1:09:05
Sure, thank you. And I apologize for earlier that we got disconnected, but Okay, so the first question is at the direction of DHS, right. So, the treasurer will write checks to people who are approved to get him. But he's going to write that check at the direction of the director of the Department of Human Services, right is putting an extra layer of protection in there because of the money Human Services is but be responsible for judging someone's criteria or eligibility to get the funds. Do this targeted relief assistance? That's what that is. And the first question, I'm sorry, I forgot. I think you said you brought up administrative oversight, I get the languages and the amendment. So yeah, the department Human Services has the administrative oversight of, of this problem. So it's every day, the decision maker, is that director, department. All on the 21st. We missed that. That's what it comes down to.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:10:23
alderman from 21st. Point. At the point you said, decision maker, you trailed off right there. We missed it. Second half. He said the decision maker and then you trailed off. 

John Collins-Muhammad, 21st Alderman  1:10:40
Okay. Can you hear me, Mr. President? Yes, yes, we can hear you. Okay. Thank you. That decision maker in this in this program, he is the director of Department of Human Services. That's the decision maker point blank, the treasurer will write the check. Who could a director tells him to write the checks? I mean, that's it. It's simplified.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:11:06
All the one from 28.

Heather Navarro, 28th ward Alderwoman  1:11:09
Thank you, Mr. President. I appreciate the clarification. I guess in reading this, this language, under the administrative oversight, the treasurer is hereby authorized to make negotiate and execute any and all contracts. So it I hear what you're saying. It seems it doesn't, doesn't seem consistent with my interpretation of, of how this actually reads. If everyone is in agreement, that that's what that means. And we are on record, and everyone is good with that, then, you know, I'm not gonna stand in the way. But reading this Language and Hearing this discussion, it's not. It doesn't seem consistent with with how we have it laid out in here. Thank you.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:11:53
All right. Thank you all the one from the 28th. Now, we will go back to who else do we have? We have the alderman from the ninth. Now, alderman from the 12th. Did you? Were you able to get your connection cleared up?

Bill Stephens, 12th ward Alderman  1:12:16
I believe I'm able to do so without much lag. Without video. Is that all right, by you president read? Yes, yes. Okay. And generally I try to stay on video. And I don't think it's in the cards today. So I do briefly want to say to the alderman from the 21st. First and foremost, thank you for your, your diligence and working on this and everything, the query that I have in my drive, and I've done a refresh, I've done a backout I closed the tab and reopened it, I think might be the wrong amendment if we're still working from amendment number 11. As amended, and if so, I think there's a perhaps an issue whereas the opening line says that we're appropriating $5 million to the Department of Human Services, but then further down and Exhibit A, it says that 5 million is being appropriated to the office of the treasurer. And then further below Exhibit A with the 153 million. And the only difference there is a 5 million so I think the D amended amendment might might not be the version that that everyone else is working off of, at least on my end. So that's just a little clerical thing. And then I want to say in response to all the questions of whether or not this is going to help, I was a homeless team twice, I was unhoused twice in my teens. I don't like to talk about I've worked very hard to to not to distance myself in those days. $500 would have helped me, you know, $500 my rent now I've an excellent landlord and excellent, Tom. So I don't agree with any argument that $500 which, or any Direct Relief will be insubstantial or used in appropriately as per our definition. I don't believe that as a legislative body, we have the right to dictate appropriate inappropriate when it comes to find that private citizens. And we saw during the pandemic that people were barely able to stay afloat with the federal relief. So I again think the alderman from the 21st we only want to perhaps small clerical issue with what is in the drive currently, again, I have refreshed several times and tried to find the correct amendment and otherwise reaffirm my my support for for Direct Relief to citizens because they are the ones who know how to help themselves fast. Those to the problem are closest to the solution. Alderman Stephens, can you speak louder? I'm sorry. Alderwoman. That's good. That's good. is better. Okay, sorry about that. A good thing my reading into this Chromebook. Um, so I again just reaffirm my, my support of Direct Relief on the basis that I believe that citizens, you know, those of us that are closest to the problem are closest to the solution. And, and I'm happy to to support the compromise that alderman from the 21st has been so amenable to So thank you again. And with that, Mr. President, I yield back with apologies to Alderwoman. Evans.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:15:33
alderman from the night.

Dan Guenther, Alderman ward 9  1:15:40
Mr. President, I'm just to make sure here because we're all having internet problems. Can you hear me?

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:15:47
Yes. Okay, thank

Dan Guenther, Alderman ward 9  1:15:49
you. So, honestly, I was going to say what the alderman from the 12th just said, I know that I came into this morning with working on a amendment number 12, which was in the drive to talk about the target cash assistance. I didn't know that the alderman from the 21st was going to be introducing amendment 11. So when that happened about four hours ago, I think we all agreed on things that we wanted to see. And and we've been working for the last six hours to get this done. So we went from I went from working on amendment 12, to then working on amendment 11. To then in our drive, we have amendment 17. And we have amendment 18. All of us that have been here, we have four different versions of this. So again, to reiterate what what the alderman from the 12th was saying, I think we all have an updated version now on Dr. Because we are back to amendment 11 with the reward. So for everyone watching out there on the world, we're on our fifth version of this, so please bear with us. So again, I started this out with saying thank you, alderman for the 21st from working on making this possible. I think that to address a couple things that I've heard over the discussion here, there was questions about accountability for this money. I think that one of the things that has been added is Section seven, right now that says evaluation plan. This was not in the bill we had five hours ago. And it says under Section seven, it says point A the Department of Human Services will work with local universities and technical assistance partner to study the impact of the program's effectiveness, effectiveness and program design and efforts to improve efficiency. So we're working on it. And we have now a section in there that addresses the concerns about how will this be evaluated. We also have a is still in there, the alderman from the 21st did a great job of kind of with his exhibit, spelling out how we're going to be accountable for this, and how we're going to make sure that it's not as what the alderman from the 22nd said of being a handout. But this is a hand up to people. We have listened to countless constituents from a local clergy that has talked about how much this money can help the the most needy in our communities. And if we don't do this, now, we're looking in two plus months before we can provide direct relief to the most needy in our community. And so part of this bill in here has in has how we are spelling out how the money will be applied for we've addressed the issues of the Alderwoman. From the eighth with the undocumented, we've addressed the issues that people have had about how we are going to allocate funds from going from 80% ami to 16% ami. So we have within six hours here, we have made this a better amendment that I want to stand up again and say that I'm going to support this. I urge my colleagues to support this. We are providing money for financial literacy programs in in here. I think that someone else could probably find it faster than me, but it talks about how we are going to for anyone that gets this assistance, we're going to offer them the ability to have financial literacy classes. And this is what we want to do. We want to provide people away to get a hand up in society. So again, thank you all again. For the 21st, I hope everyone has refreshed their drive to get the clean copy of what we're looking at what we're debating, because we really have five versions that we've been looking at here for last six hours. So I'll yield. I hope that everyone will support this. And thank you Mr. President.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:20:25
alderman from third famous president. I just want to make

Brandon Bosley, 3rd ward Alderman  1:20:36
100% clear on what are we doing now? There's a lot going on. Alright, this is a minute 11. And I just want to make sure I was like striking out the empowerment piece. Are we are we keeping me so it says it I can read it down. But it says, I don't know if you can see me. But down here at the bottom it says residents will be provided provided with financial problem materials prior to disbursement of funds and invited to participate in a financial empowerment coach. So I know what everybody else's problem or issue seems to be coming back and forth from seems like it's the implementation piece, from what I read. Looks like everybody got the same amount of power, and it's just gonna be like a struggle. I, I'm just saying what I from what I see, it looks like these people have the same amount of power, there's no overseers like, look at me, I look at you. We agree with you. And we agree or not, then we'll be like, back to the Board of Aldermen trying to figure out who can negotiate, you know, kind of mitigate this thing. When you read it. I'm just saying that it's all down reading. I just want to point this out. And I want to put this out here, this isn't this is not against art. This is not against those individuals that are putting forth the 12th. amendment there. This isn't against the the mayor's office. Yeah, we are just trying to figure this thing out. It's like do people need assistance, or they don't. And that's what we're trying to ensure that we make the correct decision on today on how that assistance will take place. What's the best way to implement that process if it is going to go through. But, you know, as we figure those things out, I do want to make sure we re implement the government. And we've said this before, the federal government just gave out millions and millions and millions about more than this administration, in the 500 little drop in the bucket that we're trying to give people and I'm not saying that it's not a lot, but they gave out more over the last few months that week that we haven't be able to give. Um,  So when you look at statistically, what that has done over the last few months, you look at analytically where people are people still shooting each other. We're still killing each other. We got domestic disputes up to an all time high homicides in every part of the country up, think about this.  We just gave out millions of dollars to people for getting sick, or for not getting sick. All the issues and problems we're talking about getting rid of people got a stimulus twice, I'm talking three or four times the 500 that we give it out. And we still are shooting each other like we never got that money. And that's not black folks. This everybody kind of every black, white, Asian, you look at stuff that's going on in the Asian communities, they got problems. You look what's going on the Bosnian community, they got problems black community problems, why community problems, we all been locked up in a house with each other where people who we love to get on our nerves from what this money is not about us just putting a bandaid for the time being the government did that. That's what this that's what the whole federal stimulus was about. Let me give you a bandaid for now. Our job as a city is to create something that has structure for the long term viability of those individuals that we act and those people we're trying to give some type of relief to know you go out and you get $500,500 $5 million to a bunch of and I'm not saying it like this, but it's gonna be what it is, gives you a bunch of dough things you give it to a bunch of people who are not accountable already to their own resources, then we are government. There's just as unaccountable as those individuals that we are trying to hold accountable. And it's not fair to expect people to do right with these funds. If we're not giving them the resources, they need to think differently about what these funds can do for them. We got relief right now. rental assistance miniata people's belief out there for your utilities, we got food out the wazoo of your own food, I've been giving out food for an entire year plus never quite works. got three crab legs. It's crazy.  Our particular resources in the federal government has allocated fundings for these particular needs, that we knew that communities of color minorities, individuals who are under resourced would need during this pandemic. These relief funds are for relief. So believe us and bring us some such bill. Now we're gonna get out here and give some people some money. Once again, we need to give them something they also can sustain themselves within, there's nothing wrong with them having to go through a class that teaches them how to utilize a little bit of these funds. And that can help differentiate those individuals, which is gonna walk up intensity for those individuals that sitting in the house right now trying to figure out how to balance their checkbook. I've got elderly people right now on a fixed income trying to figure out how to mix that mix 100 or $200 stretch and they're not under no circumstances on their way to being out, but they are one check away from they are one bad financial decision from being in a place where they don't want to be. And I'm not saying this is the all else entails. But once again, the government has provided resources for us and this is outside of this government. And we look at what we analytically stand from those disbursements that were three times four times five times what we're trying to give out. Now, you ask these people that are out here right now, or has it put them in a long term stability playing some type of you know, situation where they could see that it affected them three years down the line, if we taught all these people about stocks, at the time when the entire market crashed, and we put half a million dollars into some guru, who knows what that $2,000 would have done for people when they got the stimulus, it's plenty of people that turn 1000s of dollars into 1000s of dollars. The reason I keep saying that is because that educational piece is extremely important. No matter what we're educating folks on individuals that are working hard every day to educate themselves on how to grab the resources that we try to get. They're going out there looking for grants. They're doing their due diligence to try to figure out how to get some home loan applications they are trying. And it's plenty of people out there that are just trying to suck the most out, but don't care how hard people are trying, they just want to get over. There needs to be some type of mechanism that differentiates those individuals that aren't really trying. I got 5000 elderly people in my ward right now that can use 500 dogs right today. And it has nothing to do with COVID. But you can easily say because the COVID, they couldn't get the extra dollars that they needed to go out and do whatever it is that they were doing, to get this little thing fixed to get a heater in the home. So with those particular things being said, you know, it shouldn't be a choice on whether whether or not people earn something, or learn something while they earn something from the pandemic, this hurt us all. And one thing we should be doing is we should be learning, that's the most important thing. That's the only thing that's gonna keep these generations now and a year from now alive is learning about what happens with the vaccination learn is about learning about what's happening with our financial situation, at some point in time, the monies that we get, we might have to pay interest loans, pay interest back home. We don't know what the feds are going to do. But we know right now that keeping those interest loans low, but we don't know when they're going to raise. And if we're not paying attention to those things, we can find ourselves in a worse off position than we are right now individually. You know, as we continue to go out here, in and point people towards these federal dollars, these federal grants and these federal stimulants, like a lot of people thought it was a good idea to go out and get the PP lock right now for folks that thought it was a good idea because their friends told them you can get this money. Brilliant idea because we've never had the opportunity to small business owners just for mounting grants because we have an auto ship. Things have changed over the last year and will continue to a few years. Did you well we need to do to allocate these funds the correct way as a city but if we do this, and we don't do it right, we open up this camera right now. We don't put it you just wish to do it at some point in time in the future, then people will feel like we're holding getting the resource Is that unnecessary opposed to saying that there has to be some new type of way that we give resources out to those who are already looking for these resources? If I go knock on doors right now I find a bunch of people who are looking for home repairs. But I looked on the Home Repair list right now, I found a bunch of people who've already searched for the resources as needed. And they're just they come or leave them a very issue or problem. A lot of folks need help they're already searching for I said, We figured out a way to give those people who are looking for give those people who are one step away, or two or three steps away from becoming what is the ultimatum here, ultimatum is being home. So ultimatum is not being in a situation where you can provide the documents necessary to prove you homeless, somebody's gonna prove prove the homes, I can walk up right now to dead. Bodies be like, I don't have a house. I will, I would, I would think, if I haven't, in the last year or two put any documents in place that gives me a permanent residence, people get become homeless every day, I got homeless people in my ward right now who are on paper, not homeless, that left, they're still have to get their mail from somewhere, they're sending their EBT card, they're sending their I didn't have identification, social security codes to a vacant house, that own paper isn't vague yet. Because nobody has reapply for occupancy in that particular place. So I'm just saying that things are a little bit different. Not every situation is you know, the same. And I'm not saying that everyone is going to apply today. But what I am saying is there are a lot of people who are trying to help themselves. And I think it'd be worth our while to maybe try something different than what the federal government has already done. They've helped us not like they couldn't, we had well, gave us hundreds, you know, gave 100 a month, and we could use it. I mean, especially as black folks here in this country, god man we couldn't got enough was never big enough, that will never be enough to happen, you got to go back generations Gen precoding. Or even after you know where we are today. So I wanted to get in looking right now, we don't give out all of this money. And we want to incentivize and find a way for individuals who are going to feel like can utilize this money and do it and utilize it in a way where there could be some type of long term effects in their lives. And it's only $500. You know, it's not like it's a million from not being able to have a job next week, it could do amazing things. And for us being able to save, we help those individuals who are out here riding around with 10 tags, for in five years, you know, expired, or two or three months expired, people just lost the jostein COVID. Those things will prevent some future actions for us. That easily our Public Safety Department will have to take when we get to a point where things get normalized and say we got to start pulling people over for bad tags or doing different things that outside COVID. We have to get back into functions of doing a swap, be utilizing funds and long term educational, I'm going to be saying we want this to be for the population of people who have historically been left out the biggest thing we've been left out of the being educated man, my folks don't get educated about credit early on, we don't have 1000s of dollars to put into finances and things is totally fine. Who knows what can be implemented if you start a very small process off of why you might want to throw it out. But I appreciate everybody there's no right or wrong. Just Just know, I'm not arguing with autumn, or anybody else. We all have wastes in our pains and what we think could move folks along in our community who you are saying needs to stop or want to progress to remember to, you know, the community talking about ours. And even if you see us going back and forth amongst each other, that doesn't mean that we're not going to glean Mr. Function smart. We just may be in not alignment necessarily right now. The way it should be handed out.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:34:40
Thank you. Thank you all the way all Alderwoman for the 19th

Marlene Davis, Alderwoman ward 19  1:34:48
do you Mr. President, members of the board, I've just been listening to everyone. And when you make something more complicated than it needs to be and makes it more difficult for you to serve people. And a comment was made probably about four or five hours ago that no one saw, it'd be so difficult when we were issuing the money previously, under COVID. And the reason why it wasn't, was because there was a lot of communication. We also kept everything in alignment with the departments that should be providing service. So that is the Department of Human Services, the Department of Health. And on rare occasions, there was a little bit going to Department of Public Safety. Yes, you could give out the money 250 to $500. But I'm telling you, when people are already stressed, and you make it difficult for them, I've experienced this, I have watched it, I have seen it, people lose it, there's going to be a lot of problems with this, if you try to have this to a three tiered process. First of all, is unnecessary. Department of Human Services is quite capable of providing all services that are required in this process, they could even have the card process. So they could continue it, not just the incentive card. But they could also have a card that is a $250 or 500, whatever it is that you finally decide on, that could all be the same process, it does not make any sense to be issuing a bunch of checks out of an entirely different department, which by which most people don't talk about, that's the State Department that is a state government department. Anyone that is not familiar with, and are has the experience to provide services, Client Services, to a mass number of people. We need to think about that, we also need to think about the partnership that the Empowerment Center has, with our region, not just the city of St. Louis, they have been extremely proactive, and being available all over providing education services, financial literacy, all of that. And I say that they should continue doing that. But I don't think it should be marred and put into a complicated situation of trying to educate 10,000 people who have no finances to think about right now. Because they're not in a financial situation to deal with a budget effectively. So that to me, is putting more of a burden on people. We also know that the incentives that are already talked about. Everybody's been talking about rent, mortgage, utilities and food. But remember, you said you can pay your sewer bill, your water bill, taxes, property taxes, all kinds of things that you can get help with. So that even goes even further than what we've been talking about. So at the end of the day, that 250 to $500. People can find some something else other than their day to day expenses, no matter what level they're on, to use that for. But I don't think it needs to be complicated. I don't think it needs to be any departments other than Department of Health and the Department of Human Services. They already have partners that they work with, who are very capable of making sure that if you're going to try to five eligibility for 10,000 people, they can get the help that they need and move that forward expeditiously. You need to have more conversation. Everybody needs to come down. It is not necessary for this to happen right now. But if it is necessary today, we need to eliminate streamline and keep it where we can make sure that client services are first with experienced entities. Thank you, Mr. President.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:39:54
Right. Thank you, alderman from the 24th

Bret Narayan, 24th Ward Alderman  1:39:58
Thank you Mr. President members of the board. The direct cash assistance is actually one of the things that I've heard the most about both from my constituency, and, you know, folks that live throughout the city. I, I just reject the notion that $500 can't be transformational. I know that I've been in a position. I know, I've heard some of my colleagues have been in a position. I know, a lot of us probably have friends and family members in a position or are currently in a position where we just don't have $500 in our savings account. There's a lot of people both in the city and the country as a whole that they don't have those funds right now. And so this $500 it, although it might not seem like a lot of money to to many of us that it would fix a flat tire to get you back to work or license your car so that you don't end up in kind of the the cyclical municipal courts that we've we've heard so much about. It's back to school money for kids. It's Christmas existing for some families. I like I said in committee, there's there's a lot of folks in St. Louis, that can't wait for months for for us to get it right. They can't wait for folks in DC to quit bigger and to get it right. They can't wait for folks in Jefferson City to get it right. But we can get this right here today in this room. And I think that we should if we can give direct assistance to folks, I think that we should.  And with that I'll yield.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:41:35
Right. Thank you. All the one for me.

Annie Rice, 8th ward Alderwoman  1:41:40
Thank you, Mr. President. I'm with the alderman from the 21st yield for question. Oh, from 21st wheel for question into all the one for me.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:41:50
Yes. Oh, one for me. Please proceed.

Annie Rice, 8th ward Alderwoman  1:41:53
Okay, thank you, alderman. I wanted to clarify, there. I think there might be a simple fix for part of the very beginning of your amendment. And if you would be amenable to a friendly amendment to because right now, it's the sentence number one of your Amendment says that the $5 million would be appropriated to the Department of Human Services, but then in the boxes. Clarifying exhibit number one, it says the Office of the treasurer would you be amenable to editing that that first sentence so that we get this to just say the treasurer's office

John Collins-Muhammad, 21st Alderman  1:42:40
will be open to a man to say, department human services. So it was a clerical error. I was moving fast to get it to get to our Google Drive. So it should say Department of Human Services, not the treasurer.

Annie Rice, 8th ward Alderwoman  1:42:55
So So when you say you're saying that the Office of the Department of Human Services is supposed to be what's in the box below? Yes. Okay. Um, so, it was my understanding that the, the compromise reached with that the money was in the office of the treasurer with, with some further monies for financial empowerment. It was that was that not your understanding of the compromise?

John Collins-Muhammad, 21st Alderman  1:43:37
After my conversation with the man style, it was concluded that the additional money is a lot it to the office manager apartment would not can grow it was not necessary. Okay.

Annie Rice, 8th ward Alderwoman  1:43:57
I guess I'm still I'm still in a position where I'm, I'm confused. I'm also confused by this amendment. So um, as the person who seconded I am, I'm also confused here. I do think this is an important thing to get done and get right. Even in the federal guidelines for the ARPA funds. They line out cash assistance as one of as one of the eligible uses for this funding. I think this is incorrect. I mean, it's a week's worth of wages for someone who's making $13 an hour to stay home if they've got a COVID positive test. And it's, you know, not even a quarter of a funeral funding, but it's it's something that could keep someone afloat if their loved one has passed away. You know, I think this is just deeply important to get right. And get this in as quickly as possible. I, you know, I thought that I guess I thought that we had a compromise On this amendment, and I'm a little bit I'm I guess I'm disappointed with where we are at the moment. I think that is that's all I have to say. Thanks.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:45:16
Thanks. Any further discussion, Any further discussion? All the men from the 21st year all 150.

Dr. Megan Green, 15th ward Alderwoman  1:45:30
Thank you, Mr. President, members of the board,

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:45:34
with the alderman from the 21st yield for questions on them for the 21st will yield the question to all one from the 15th? Yes.

Dr. Megan Green, 15th ward Alderwoman  1:45:46
Can you just walk us through kind of what your understanding was of the compromise with the mayor's office? So that sort of we're all on the same Page here, because I, you know, I think we all want to get to the same goal here. And there is an inconsistency. Being appropriate

John Collins-Muhammad, 21st Alderman  1:46:09
Alderwoman this is I'm not, I'm not trying to be rude. We've been debating this for the last five hours, if any, wants to offer an amendment for right to do so. But I'm not gonna continue to go back and forth about the same process. We've been debating. And that's laid out in the legislation. I'm not doing that. This is a waste of our time. If we learn anything from COVID-19 time is the most important thing to us. If anyone wants to offer amendment Go right ahead. But I'm not gonna go back and forth and talk about the same legislation and talk about periods and not and talk about what office and what agency, essentially everything is under the mayor, regardless, everything is under domain. If anybody wants to offer them in the right now to change, Human Services, Treasurer or Treasury Human Services, go right ahead and do it. I'm not going to be a block or barricade in a wait. I just want to get this done. That's it.

Dr. Megan Green, 15th ward Alderwoman  1:47:04
And apologies. All right. I'm just trying to understand the process here because I was I was not in those conversations. So I'm trying to just understand where where we're at here. So that I can wrap my mind around whether this is going to treasurer's whether this is going to DHS whether this is Sunday.

John Collins-Muhammad, 21st Alderman  1:47:27
Can I make a friendly amendment to change department human services to the office of financial impact to the office of the treasurer?

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:47:37
you currently do not have the floor from the 21st. So the

Dr. Megan Green, 15th ward Alderwoman  1:47:51
CIO hearing, I think what the Alderwoman from the 21st just said, I think the friendly amendment be to strike in the first the end of the very first line, after the word section 13. Strike the words Department of Human Services, and instead put in office of the treasurer.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:48:24
Yeah, Alderwoman from the 15th. You have the floor. So so you, you have the ability to amend the amendment, if you would like I don't know if it's going to be friendly or not. But do you do have the opportunity to amend the amendment? Solomon from the 21st didn't sound real happy. We'll find that out during the debate. But

Dr. Megan Green, 15th ward Alderwoman  1:48:50
you have your preference would be to to yield to the alderman from the 21st ward. And so that's why I'm trying to understand where we're kind of adding

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:49:02
us getting increasingly and his connection bad. So he's going to jump back in a second, I'm sure. Crucially, frustrated after dealing with it all day. And the debate seems to be about which department opposed to the fact that he's now cleared the way for people to actually get the money. So that's kind of what I what I took from it when he said that, you know, we keep going back about this department, that department, this department, that department, and let's get away from us his time. And I know he's frustrated been working on it all day to get this medicine in front of us. And we'll remind people we still have a rest of the board meeting to go we have a bunch of other stuff on on that on a procession

Dr. Megan Green, 15th ward Alderwoman  1:50:02
time just just trying to make sure that this is consistent in this amendment here and would prefer to do it in a way that is amenable to the alderman from the 21st. Ward, who has been, you know, under fire for this all day? Oh, yeah. I will lost connection. So I will, I will yield it over to the Alderwoman to the eighth, who has her hand up at the moment. And when the alderman for the 21st gets back on, we can revisit that.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:50:32
All right, all of them. For me.

Annie Rice, 8th ward Alderwoman  1:50:35
As President, I think this is highlighting the immense issues of doing this online. You know, just thinking about a legislative special session and how much we would have aides running around and folks pulling papers around and we'd have we'd have clerks and folks drafting and things that so I am thank you all for sticking with us for so long. I would like to make a friendly amendment to amendment number 11 to strike the words. Director or the Department of Human Services in line, just in the very first sentence under Section 13. I'm going to replace it with the office of the treasurer.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:51:11
It's been moved by all the woman from the eighth and yet don't call it a friendly amendment because we don't know that yet. it's it's a it's an amendment mine. And I would want to roll call, because I'm not sure that alderman from 2013. Mr. President, has a back up.

John Collins-Muhammad, 21st Alderman  1:51:34
Thank you, Mr. President. So we've been doing this back and forth now. So it was already agreed upon that the Department of Human Services,

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:51:44
all the men from the 21st hold one second, I just want to make an order. All the ones who made you technically still have the floor. Are you are you made a motion? I know you made the motion to amend

Annie Rice, 8th ward Alderwoman  1:52:01
amendment 11. Line one under Section 13. from the Department of Human Services to the office of the treasurer and not in.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:52:12
Okay, it's been moved by all along from the eighth. Is there a second? Second, all the one for the 15th. Okay. Anything further all one for sure. I

Annie Rice, 8th ward Alderwoman  1:52:29
just this is to bring the text of the bill in line with the box below. In order of the amendment, I'm sorry. So that the text of the amendment matches with what is in the box below. And per the last time into the alderman from the 21st that asked if someone wanted to make a motion Go for it. I made the motion. So be happy. Let's you have your favorable consideration.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:52:58
All women from the 21st. You recognize.

John Collins-Muhammad, 21st Alderman  1:53:06
Thank you, Mr. President. My communication with the office has been simple. The Department of Human Services will oversee the program, the treasurer's office will write the checks. Because that's the office that's the crew to write the checks. So if we're talking about change, you say and change the first section to take out the Department of Human Services, which basically makes them non void throughout the entire board bill, I'm against that. That's what I'm saying now, if we ever want to, if we're going to put make sure that this board bill is in perfect line and perfectly st, then let's do it. And that's what I was saying earlier. And that's what I thought the intention was when we when we want to make an amendment to make sure that we do this correctly. I'm not in favor of taking out the Department of Human Services. I want to make sure that's clear. I'm not in favor of that whatsoever. If we're going to make sure this war bill is in sync, and it follows a protocol we needed to to make sure that it is productive and an efficient program. Let's do it. But I am not in favor. And I am opposed to the amendment being offered by the automa from the eighth. Right. Thank

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:54:19
you all. Thank you all. alderman from the 22nd Yes, this president of the board, but the other one from the eighth deal. How long from late will yield to alderman from the 22nd I will Alderwoman. With so

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  1:54:35
much going on. I just want to be clear what  what is your motion again please is the motion to change.

Annie Rice, 8th ward Alderwoman  1:54:41
So only line one of the text of amendment number 11. So section 13. There are hereby appropriated $5 million in the 2021 Coronavirus, local fiscal recovery funds the Department of Human Services.  That is the only line that I want to change from Department of Human Service to say the Office of the treasurer 

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  1:54:59
and why

Annie Rice, 8th ward Alderwoman  1:55:00
 It because that then makes the whole billing agreement because right now there is a discrepancy between the language. So okay.

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  1:55:08
Yeah. Okay, so why don't we just change the discrepancy on the backend of the legislation? Why don't we change? We're in the word talks about the treasurer at the bottom to help the Human Services. Why not do that change? 

Annie Rice, 8th ward Alderwoman  1:55:22
Because it was my impression that that was not the agreement that was reached. 

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  1:55:27
Oh, okay. Well, I'm still not convinced that it should be in the treasurer's office. And I appreciate you know, you trying to clean this up. But that's the sucker move. So, okay, go for that. Sorry.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:55:47
Thank you. Thank you all. All one from the 15th. Thank you, Mr. Bird. I second Parliament from the 23rd. Did you have your hand up? I heard you say, here's my hand, and I haven't seen it. It's just Oh, sorry. Sorry about that. Oh, oh, you don't have the thing on the iPad? I'm sorry. I've been looking at the side panel. So by doing this, yeah, I haven't seen that. Sorry. Sorry about that. Go ahead, alderman from 23rd. Yeah, you know, alderman Mohammed has worked hard, has

Joe Vaccaro, 23rd ward Alderman  1:56:27
bent over to make sure that this was taken care of. And we get the same thing coming back. It's a game. I'm tired of the game. We should support. But jack, what alderman Mohammed was bringing forth after he talked to the mayor's office, I strongly would say that we should not vote yes, on this amendment vote this amendment. It's a game. And I agree with Alderman Boyd, let's just take the treasurer's name out then. If that's what you want to do, I'm I am so tired of this game after seven hours. And on the Mohammed went way out of his way to try to fix us talking to the mayor's office. And all all this is going to happen, because I think the majority of all of us would have voted to get the money out. The way the bill has is the way it is now. I guarantee I won't support it if we take it and make any changes to it. Because again, ultimate Mohamad worked hard to make sure that he worked with the mayor's office. And he came up with a reasonable compromise. But apparently, to certain people on this board compromise means do it our way. That's not a compromise. alderman Mohammed, john, my friend, thank you for the hard work. And I'm sorry, that certain people on this board want to drag you down and only support what they want. No matter how they work. They don't care if the people get the money or that they just want to get their way. Right now. This bill will pass this amendment will pass. At least if they don't mess with it. If they mess with it. I strongly encourage my colleagues to see through this and vote no one this amendment. Thank you.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:58:34
Thank you, all the one from the 15th.

Dr. Megan Green, 15th ward Alderwoman  1:58:38
Thank you, Mr. President, members of the board, I want to be clear that this is not a game for any of us who are who are here today. And I think we're all looking to make sure that this is done in the most consistent way. The The issue is that in the amendment, as it stands right now, the money is appropriated to two different entities in the first line of the section, it is appropriated to the Department of Health, human services. And then later on, when you get into the the, let's see 123, the fourth paragraph down, then it authorizes the Office of the treasurer to do the appropriation. So in one place, it's authorizing the Department of Human Services to do the appropriation, and another place it is authorizing the Office of the treasurer to do the appropriation. So it is inconsistent in the amendment which is is the issue. Not nobody's taking, I think any issue with the compromise that was reached I think the the issue is that I'm actually not sure if there's an inconsistent see like this in the amendment. And this is passed as a board bill. And it says that the money goes to DHS and one place and it goes to the office of the treasurer and another place, where does the money actually go? And so, I think that if we're going to do this correctly, we need to rectify that inconsistency. To make sure that that we are passing something out that does that I don't think this was done in intentional I think, you know, everybody's working really hard and is drafting things very quickly today, without a lot of staff support. And so sometimes when that when that happens, these these things happen. And we need to just clean up the language to make sure that it is consistent throughout this amendment. And so if if that the other piece of that the human services component is not taken out of the amendment, and the process that is outlined in this is that the Department of Human Services has the oversight of the program, and the treasurer's office, is responsible for extending the funds. And so it would make sense for the the money to be going to the entity that expends the funds, even though it is the department that is overseeing it, and has administrative oversight, as listed in this amendment is the Department of Human Services. And that is not being changed in in this amendment. The Alderwoman from the eighth is not asking to change that she is only asking to make a change to make sure that where this money is being appropriated is consistent in all sections of this amendment. Um, I actually if the Alderwoman from the first would entertain a question

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  2:02:31
here, I think she may have stepped away. Do you have anything further along than the 15?

Dr. Megan Green, 15th ward Alderwoman  2:02:39
That is it for me. Thank you.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  2:02:41
All Alderwoman of the 21st. Yes, Mr. President. Do you have anything further on on the amendment? I know you I know you had pointed out that are in that bottom table where it says additionally, insert the following into board bill to committee substitute as amended exhibit one under the Office of the treasurer. appropriation. Originally, you said that that that was supposed to be the Department of Human Services and insert into the following line item an update of the total as follows. And then just the title in that first table, I think is what you said should have been Department of Human Services. Am I correct with that? Yes. So I don't know if everybody sees that. There. They're just a couple Scribbler error, errors, that typo at the bottom. It's it's in the third paragraph down. Well, if you count the first, begin on Page 12, as a paragraph you go that then the main paragraph, then the further and we're says Additionally, insert the following into board bill number two committee substitute as amended exhibit one, under the Office of the treasurer that should, according to the alderman from the 21st that should say under the Office of the Department of Human Services. appropriations, insert the following line items and then just the title in that table should say Department of Human Services So Alderwoman from the eighth. If you want to withdraw your motion, the alderman from the 21st is still having connectivity issues he, he prompts in in and bouncing back out. I think the alderman from the 23rd could make that motion just to clear, clear up that type of

Annie Rice, 8th ward Alderwoman  2:05:27
Mr. President, I don't wish to withdraw the amendment at the moment, because I think they're there. I understand what you're saying that there's a possibility.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  2:05:35
I'm just saying that that's what the sponsor says that it should be.

Annie Rice, 8th ward Alderwoman  2:05:40
Okay. If I could finish. So what you're saying is that, so the box that represents exhibit one, if that if the language under that in three different places when change the Department of Human Services, that does not cure the discrepancy, that's in the first paragraph under Section 13. Because section 13 says, under the administrative oversight of the director of Department of Human Services, the treasurer or his or her designee are hereby authorized to make negotiate and execute any and all contracts and that they shall be responsible for implementing the program and dispersing payments. So if the treasurer's office is responsible for dispersing payments, the money has to go into the treasurer's office. That's why I'm saying the only the only clear cleanup of this language is to change only sentence one, not the oversight of the Department of Human Services, or any of the rest of the input of Department of Human Services. Only that initial line that says, currently says Department of Human Services should say the Department of the Treasury or the treasurer's office is they will be the ones dispersing the funds. Otherwise, we're going to be bouncing money around from department to department. And that's that was not the intent of the draft. If that was then we need to change more in this amendment than just my amendment to the amendment as suggested.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  2:06:59
The treasurer's office is the entity that cuts checks for all sorts of things in the city of St. Louis. And the funds start out in the various different departments and the but the treasurer's office distributes and cuts checks. So I can understand why the ultimate from 21st head, it's structured that way. Because the funds would still be in the Department of Human Services. And when the checks need to be cut, or whatever it needs to be our cated those transfers would be made. But I'm getting deep into the woods on this conversation. I'm trying to help out. People are having connectivity issues. But but I'm gonna leave it at I'm going to leave it at that I'm not going to engage any further discussion on it. Hopefully I don't ask any questions of you, Mr. President. I know you that I was trying to help the help move help. Fill in the blank since we since few people are having major connectivity issues. Right now, open the document from 21st will be able to join us again, but seem like he's, as I'm trying to come in a few minutes ago, and it just went right back out. So Alderwoman from the from the eighth year, you're welcome to proceed with your

Annie Rice, 8th ward Alderwoman  2:08:30
members, the board, I realized that this is a is an incredibly long meeting. And we are not trying to play games there is this is this is money that is crucial to people, we are trying to get this out the door as quickly as possible. And the simplest way to cure what is merely an error in this bill, to continue to hold the intent. And the spirit of the amendment, as offered by the alderman from the 21st is to change is to accept this amendment to the amendment. That would change the very first line to just say the Office of the treasurer. I don't know if there's any clearer way to do it, because otherwise the Department of Human Services would have to work through another appropriation in order to send this money to the treasurer. So this is the clearest, most direct way to uphold the spirit of the amendment. And I would ask for your favorable consideration

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  2:09:24
all the men from the 20s and all the one from eighth. I would not say that, that that was the intent, or whatever of the alderman from the eighth of may 20/21. And it's a weird situation. This this connectivity is you I just want to make sure that you know if your amendment passes, that the alderman from the 21st won't have a major issue that you Sandy's in support of alderman from 22nd. You recognize Mr. President, with the auto from a four year for questions how long for a three year question. home from 22nd. I Well,

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  2:10:02
I want First of all, I want to say I do think that we should provide some clarity. So I'm with you on that. But let me ask you this, you know, we always hear about this regional approach to, you know, sticks in our, our region, right? It's, you know, but it seems like, it's really when we talk about a regional approach, what we're really saying is the St. Louis city property. Would you agree with that? I'm saying when we talk about when we talk about a regional approach to solving crime, to solving homelessness, to solving the regional issues, it's really people saying it's a city of St. Louis problem. Would you agree with that? No, I would not agree with that. Okay. I wouldn't even so thank you. So where is St. Louis count? on all these direct payments, were in St. Louis, count on all the initiatives for the unhoused population? Worse, they say St. Louis County is bigger than the St. Louis city. But it seems like my colleagues want to put on their shoulders, you know, all the burdens of solving the regional problems. So I mean, so So talk to me a little bit about why does that seem to be the case.

Annie Rice, 8th ward Alderwoman  2:11:28
So and in this particular example, the money was allocated to us here in the city and not to the county, so we are using it to address our citizens most direct needs the most vulnerable, our citizens direct needs, I will say, the county, especially in the area of unhoused services was an incredible partner over the course of the pandemic, when we were looking for housing when we were looking for care for COVID positive or COVID exposed on house people. The county was incredible in helping us house those folks and get them rehabilitated. So this, I can't speak to what county executive Sam Page is working on with the county's allocation of ARPA funds. I know that this is what we were given. And this is a a permissible use of the funds as described by the Department of the Treasury. And I think that we we owe it to our citizens to get this piece out.

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  2:12:22
So so that's exciting to hear you say that the county was incredible, with their support. So give me some examples of the incredibility. You know, what was so phenomenal about what the county did to help out with the unhoused population?

Annie Rice, 8th ward Alderwoman  2:12:36
They had beds for COVID positive and COVID exposed unhoused neighbors that we did not have? 

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  2:12:42
And where were they? 

Annie Rice, 8th ward Alderwoman  2:12:44
I don't have a specific location.

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  2:12:47
Why didn't anybody know you've never heard about it in the news. We heard about the current exam, given all these press conferences and briefings about so much going on in St. Louis County, not one time, did I hear him talking about the unhoused? population? So did I miss something?

Annie Rice, 8th ward Alderwoman  2:13:04
I can't speak to what the news media covers and what they don't I know that I've been on calls nearly every Tuesday, the pandemic, with partners from the county and partners from the city and all around, and we know where people were being moved to and being cared for. And that was both here in the city and in the county. And and

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  2:13:23
so the pandemic started, and basically march of 2020, is that correct? That's right, right. Yeah. Okay. And so we were having weekly updates with the previous mayor, about what's going on in the city of St. Louis, and even county data in St. Charles County, and so on. So right? That's correct. And I will on I was on quite a few of those phone calls. And I know you were as well. And not one time, did I hear anything about what the county was doing to support the pandemic and to support the unhoused population? What I heard was, the city basically is not doing enough. So I'm just a little perplexed about, you know, all the phenomenal work that St. Louis County did. And there was no mention of it in the media, nor on any conference call that we had. So why was I just absent on the conference calls where we were alerted about, you know, all the initiatives that St. Louis County was supporting us on as a regional as a region.

Annie Rice, 8th ward Alderwoman  2:14:27
So alderman I, you know, don't want to speak for the previous administration. But when the county is having to step up and fill our gaps this time around, it's not something that an administration normally advertises.

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  2:14:40
No, no, certainly it is because the current administration is very good at PR. I'm I think they are exceptional. I wish I could hire some of the people that do the PR because, you know, they got together with a county and sued the state of Missouri over the Medicaid expansion situation, right.

Annie Rice, 8th ward Alderwoman  2:14:58
I'm sorry, if I could, I think we are in Incredibly off topic, and I would No, no, no, no, no, no. At this point we have we have a new clarification, I would like to withdraw my amendment to the amendment.

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  2:15:10
Okay. No further questions. Thank you. 

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  2:15:13
All right. Thank you. Thank you all. So we're, we're back to members. membered number 11. If there is any further discussion, hopefully. It's been moved by all women from the 21st. Second, Mr. President, yes, yes. All the woman.

Annie Rice, 8th ward Alderwoman  2:15:36
I'm very sorry. I know you didn't want to call me again. The The, the amendment at this point would be to follow along with your suggested amendments. Down at the very bottom. I'm dealing with exhibit one, where it says the Office of the treasurer appropriation where that $5 million is in those boxes. And in that text, if that can be changed to the Department of Human Services, I think we'll be good to go. Yes.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  2:16:01
It's been moved by all the one from the eighth that we change the words department of the treasure to Department of Human Services. mentioned places the

Marlene Davis, Alderwoman ward 19  2:16:16
original amendment by the alderman 21st. Ward.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  2:16:20
Yes, yes. But move but all along for a second about alderman from the 23rd. I believe. VOTE BEING TAKEN All in favor signify by saying aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Motion carries. Now was before us is the amendment number 11. To board bill number two committee substitute as amended. Any further discussion on that? alderman from the 22nd.

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  2:16:52
For the board,  I still rise in opposition to this amendment. Because it's not right. I know we have this marathon meeting right now. And people have objectives that they want to accomplish. People want to be able to say I got the win in and I got the knockout. But this is not right. And I stand in total opposition of this, we should not be giving out direct payments to people without some expectation that they're going to help themselves. Just government giveaways and enabling people and I get I will go back to the whole theory of, you know, see, we need to teach people how to fish and not just keep giving them fish. And all we're doing is giving people fish right now, we're not teaching them anything, we're not getting anything back on them $5 million, that we're going to appropriate for people to use to do what else because we cannot legislate what they can use the money for. But if we put in there that they have to go to some classes, and they have to empower themselves, then we get to the next level. But I can see what some of my colleagues and I'm trying not to get totally upset, because they have no freaking clue about what it's like to be poor, and live in neighborhoods like that goody two shoes and go get it done. You can pat yourself on the back that you've talked about how you helped us all you want to, but that is not good enough. We need to be empowered, not enabled. And I am diametrically opposed to this amendment period.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  2:18:36
Right. Thank you. Thank you all. All along on the 15th.

Dr. Megan Green, 15th ward Alderwoman  2:18:45
Thank you, Mr. President, members of the board, I'm going to keep it very brief. I just want to thank the alderman from the 21st Ward for hanging in there with this today. I know it's been a difficult day, our emotions are all like running high. We're all probably very hangry at this point in the day and would like to be doing something else. But I you know, I appreciate taking the time to work through this and get us to a point where this is consistent and something that I think that we all can agree upon. You know, folks, I think throughout the city really are counting on us to do this and do it correctly. And, and so thank you for for taking the time to to work with variety of folks to get this done. And I will I will rest with that because I know we are all tired of hearing each other Talk.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  2:19:37
Thank you. I'm Alderwoman Peele, excuse me all one from the 17th.

Tina "Sweet T" Pihl, 17th ward Alderwoman  2:19:47
Thank you, Mr. President, and members of the board. I just want to make a comment regarding I agree with Alderman Boyd regarding needing to teach people how to fish. And is there another way, and I'll just throw it out there, but we might not discuss it, you know, another way in which we can have financial empowerment classes, even if it's in the Human Services Department. At this point in time, I just make another comment. I do believe that we do need to have, it would be great if we had classes or those individuals receiving the $500.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  2:20:35
Alright. All the men from the 22nd Mr. President, I'll request a roll call please. Okay. All right. It's been moved by on from 21st seconded by the Alderwoman from the eighth that we adopt and then that number 11 as amended. Madam Clerk, please call now. Please call

Thank you, Mr. President. I would like to introduce, make a motion to introduce amendment number six. It's in the Google Drive for alderman.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  2:26:41
Please tell us about the amendment.

Christine Ingrassia, 6th ward Alderwoman  2:26:45
So amendment six to bar bill to committee substitute as amended, I think really clarifies the fact that almost the entirety of the board is supportive of the veterans project that we are moving forward with. And it's incredibly important in the city. So intentional encampments are basically the same thing as the veterans project is including so they are single, both single singular occupancy transition homes. They both have outreach centers for wraparound services, food and hygiene kits employment support with the ultimate goal of finding supportive housing. And I think maybe being hasty. The new administration called them intentional encampments. Which if you Google, it turns up a number of places in the country that support intentional encampments. And maybe Tiny Homes is a better set of like, nomenclature for the city of St. Louis. But um, basically, the veterans project Tiny Homes are the exact same things that we are trying to accomplish with an intentional encampment. In fact, the only city that I could find in the entire country that had actual tents, and not Tiny Homes was in Denver, where they used ice fishing tents. That being said, a number of cities like there's too many to name, but for all of us, San Francisco, Indianapolis, Philadelphia, Seattle, Tacoma, Berkeley, Fresno, Minneapolis, Austin, there are a huge number of cities that are undertaking temporary, tiny home or intentional encampments as a way to address the fact that there are some folks who don't want to leave the streets with immediacy. We also do not have

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  2:29:14
a follow up Alderwoman from from six to do a motion on it just so that you don't forget and a little bit. You'd like to make a motion

Christine Ingrassia, 6th ward Alderwoman  2:29:27
to make a motion to amend board bill to committee substitute as amended to

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  2:29:33
include amendment number six then going on from six seconded by the home for the night. Alright, great.

Christine Ingrassia, 6th ward Alderwoman  2:29:42
Thank you for being so kind president. I appreciate it. And I will now carry on. So we have a huge issue with our unhoused population and we are not addressing it appropriately. We need to have low barrier and no barrier barrier shelters we need to have low barrier, no barrier, permanent supportive housing. And we are not addressing the long term needs of our most vulnerable unhoused population. And so creating Tiny Homes or intentional encampments, just as we would, for everyone who was supportive of the veterans project, is something that we should all be supporting. And I'm not saying where they should be. I'm not arguing today, that alderman should not be allowed to opt out of where those occur. I've tried desperately for over a year to find space in the sixth Ward, where that makes sense. But I would hope that, based on the support have Tiny Homes for veterans that the Board of Aldermen supported that we can also wrap our arms around these same types of constituents who have received such a poor welcome from many of our typical places where they would find sanctuary. And so I'm asking for an increase in $750,000 to $1.5 million, so that we can do something better than the fishing tents, ice fishing tents that Denver did, and create a more permanent space for folks. And that would go through the Board of Public Service, and I'm happy to take questions.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  2:31:55
alderman from the 22nd.

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  2:31:58
Yes, thank you, Mr. President, members aboard Alderwoman from the sixth word for questions,

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  2:32:04
one through six will yield the question to the elements in 22nd. I'd be happy to.

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  2:32:11
Thank you. Thank you. Alderwoman. So there's conversation about tiny houses conversation about veterans homes, and certainly someone who has served my country for 23 years, definitely supportive veteran homes, which is a project that aligns with the 18th Ward 19th Ward and the Fourth Ward and as a phenomenal project that's going on. And those homes are actually like, apartments. They're like little tiny, small apartments, right. And so those are like, the veteran homes. And then we have what people would call the Tiny Homes. And those are the homes where people can find at Jefferson and cats. Think that's know, Jefferson? Yeah, that's Jefferson in case correct me

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  2:33:03
if I'm wrong.

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  2:33:05
Yeah. Okay, so so so there are tiny houses so that the difference between those homes and the veterans homes are, those Tiny Homes are just a kind of like a box with a bed and a desk. And then there's a facility where you go in, and it's a common area facility where you go take a shower, and so on and so forth. Whereas in the veterans homes, you actually have, it's like a little apartment, you have a shower, you have a kitchen. It's really like, it's really neat. It's like an apartment. And certainly, that's kind of like a premium home to me over a tiny home. And so I just want to be clear, that when we have this conversation, that there's a distinction between the two, and, and countless, because what came out a couple of weeks or so ago about intentional, I can't mess it was pretty defined. And there was conversation about taking over the playground area, basically of a school yard and people sleeping in their tents. And allegedly, you know, maybe they'll work with the school district and they can use somehow the facilities, I'm guessing that they would have gone into some of the buildings that have recently closed because the four or five schools as closed in my ward would not be conducive for that because they've been destroyed, basically, even though there was a promise since 2003. They were mothball them and make them safe so they could be usable one day, but that was all a trick, but that's neither here nor there. So these buildings that have recently closed, it was my understanding as the conversation went that we could use those school sites for in Canton. So truly, there's like three different levels. So I'm not sure you're accurate when you kind of blend them. I don't think that's fair. And maybe you didn't mean to do that intentionally, because intentional encampments was very clear. And that's why you have the majority of the black alderman across the city that says No way, not in my backyard, because we didn't want to have people in tents across the streets from residential housing. And, and, and a haven for drug dealers to prey on. That is the reason why out in this board bill, you have majority of the black autumn and several white on this is Hector, now that we were not going to do that. So let's be clear about what we're talking about here. You know, so you started off by talking about intentional catalysts. And maybe it was a mis word, and I saw I'm paraphrasing you, but you kind of like made it seem like intentional. capmas was like Tiny Homes. No, it's not. It's a far cry from Wait, hold up. No, it is.

Christine Ingrassia, 6th ward Alderwoman  2:36:07
If you look up, if you go into one camp, it is it is very much the same thing as a tiny home.

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  2:36:13
Okay, so I have the floor, but you're not gonna let me finish. Because I will come back to you how to respect. I'm gonna let you finish. What I'm talking.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  2:36:22
I'm sorry, Mr. President. Yeah, hold on a second. Alderwoman. You are not interrupt the alderman when I speak in just like he's not to interrupt you when you're speaking. Thanks, Dad. Stop all the women that that was inappropriate. It's been a long meeting. We're all working to make it through it.

Christine Ingrassia, 6th ward Alderwoman  2:36:49
need to be paternalistic to me, Alderman. So this person in the conversation you did not need to interject. Yes.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  2:36:58
Yes, I did. Because you because you were interrupting him. That's not the way you operate on this floor. So yes, you were were in erupting them. anytime anybody does that on the floor. I try to I try to intervene. But we're not going any further than that. All in from 22nd. You still have the floor. Please continue.

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  2:37:20
Okay, so thank you. So um, and again, I want people to recognize that point of border. That just happened because it was very disrespectful. It was very disrespectful. And that's why we are worried today. And I'm really hoping that after today that we can still communicate with each other because it has been a long day. And emotions are high about certain things that are said. But I think we need to really govern ourselves with a lot of respect, whether we're upset with each other or not. So I go back to say that I'm going by what the ministration had put out about intentional and countless and, and I'm willing, I'm gonna use when you get a chance all to learn from mistakes, you can explain what they really meant. But I'm gonna tell you what my constituents and I heard that there were going to be kits put up in our community in the schools. And that was the definition of an attentional campement. And again, that is why I'm saying that we as black alderman nos, I said heck to the No, that we were not going to support that. Because they will never accept that in tower Grove. They will never accept that in Lafayette Square. They will never accept that in the Central West. And they will never accept that any of Floyd neighborhood in the city of St. Louis. So let's not do the smoke and mirrors. Let's not do the word salad. Were we just trying to say? Well, that's really not what they meant. Yes, it is what they meant. No, alfalfa was very clear. The mass policy advisor and development director, whatever, he was very clear on what intention on campus work. And that's why we were like, no way, Jose. So there's three different buckets that I see here. The intentional cabinet where people are nerve tense that just like downtown, the storm came in blew everything away. Boy, that was a disaster. And then you have the tiny homes where they have no facilities inside the Tiny Homes, they must go to a central ask area where they can shower. They whatever they have to do, I call it the three S's but I can't tell you what are their main military, but they go and clean themselves up in a centralized area. But they have their own space in the Tiny Homes, to lay their head down with a desk and so on and so forth. And then you have the Veterans Home let's not let's not confuse the three now let's be real. So the Veterans Home is like a modular house. It's a tiny house. Really. That's what it is. And that's pretty cool, as far as I'm concerned, so I just want to correct the language that we're using, so that when people are listening to this, that they're not confused about what's going on. And with all due respect, or the one for the 640. And you know, you and I have had a very good relationship, you know, over the years that you've been at the border, and I am here, I'm not a smoke and mirror type guy. I want to tell the truth. And if I'm wrong, I'm willing to apologize and say, I'm wrong with what I said, because I had misinformation. But I was very clear. When it was well publicized from the ministration on what intentional encampments were, which is totally different from Tiny Homes, which is totally different from bettors house. And now yield to you for response.

Christine Ingrassia, 6th ward Alderwoman  2:40:56
Thank you so much, Alderman Boyd, appreciate you bringing up our relationship over the years. I know that we disagree a lot. And we also agree a lot. And always appreciate the conversation. Um, I think it was probably a bit of a mistake for the administration to call Tiny Homes intentional encampments. And maybe because of my advocacy on that, it's my fault. If you Google intentional encampments, you will find a number of cities again, San Francisco and in the app list, Philadelphia, Seattle, Tacoma, Berkeley, Fresno, Minneapolis, Austin, there are at least 50 cities who have done this. And the model is Tiny Homes, there's only one city that is used actual tents. And that is Denver, and they used ice fishing tents, because they thought it would be a cost savings. And so this would not nullify anyone who has opted out of even though I disagree. Like, I don't think constitutionally, we can just like opt out of our wards, does not require awards to still participate if they're opting out under this board bill. But allows us to actually pay for pallet shelters or Tiny Homes. And that's what I've been advocating for. For the past year. Since COVID. became an issue. I have never been so connected to an issue or so passionate about an issue. These folks similar to veterans, without again, I'm going to say the veterans project is single single occupancy homes, their transitional homes, they have a community center, they have an outreach center, they have food and hygiene kits, they have employment support, with the ultimate goal to find permanent supportive housing. We need intentional accompaniments, or if you want to call them Tiny Homes, that's what we will call them because we are also lacking and we have some funding now available to provide low barrier and no barrier shelters to folks in need. And we also have money set aside to provide permanent supportive housing. Some of our unhoused neighbors are going to always require permanent supportive housing. And an intentional I can't make our Tiny Homes or whatever you want to call them is the first step to making that happen.

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  2:43:45
And I can support the Tiny Homes over their kitchen cabinets. But let me ask you this Alderwoman Do you have any land in Lafayette Square that we can put these Tiny Homes in that you would support? Because I would love to earmark some funds for specific geography within your neighborhood

Christine Ingrassia, 6th ward Alderwoman  2:44:09
Alderwoman from the 22nd I could not agree with you more. I have been desperately trying to find land within the sixth Ward that would make sense for an intentional encampment. I know not everyone follows me on Twitter, which I mean maybe you all should but was incredibly disappointed by amarin recently because they have land that meets all of the requirements for an intentional candidate or a tiny home village that's not immediately adjacent to a densely residential area or a densely you know, area of a business district and they would not I tried for probably a month to get them to have a meeting with me. They wouldn't even have me With me about late, that's the only spot in this ward. And so, again, I'm not telling any alderman who has opted out that they should allow it intentional encampments, I understand that we are disproportionately relying on the north side to take care of our unhoused neighbors. And that's not enough. We also have an issue where we need to figure out if there is land that is assembled that doesn't distract from the typical neighborhood in business interactions. I will also say that if you do your research, I think Denver with his speciality and Seattle and Tacoma, I talked to all of these folks multiple times, all of their neighbors were concerned that this would be a detriment to their neighborhood. And they are sad that they are like moving out because some of these zoning requirements in other cities require intentional encampments, or Tiny Homes to be disassembled because they don't adhere to zoning requirements. So I think we're just missing the mark, if we don't allow our city to try this. I mean, we keep putting band aids on everything. I think I mentioned that earlier about something else. We just need to try to do something different. And if it doesn't work, then we disassemble it.

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  2:46:35
Yeah. Yeah. And I'm not sure just disassembly would be the answer. I'm gonna go back to something a mirror kept talking about which I have to give it to her, she ran up a nominal campaign, she talked a lot about a regional approach to public safety, and all of that. And I bought into that. I mean, I, it was a good story. However, we're not living it out. There's no examples of how we are regionally trying to address this issue. I'm sure if we went out and St. Louis County, and we didn't have to add sound pay, I'm sorry, I didn't work on Santa Fe, county executive Sam Page for permission. And if we could just go out there and put a flag up somewhere in St. Louis County, I guarantee you, we could find some unincorporated parts of St. Louis County, where we can actually build this seeing, you know, the church, no encampments, as you call it, the Tiny Homes, it reminds me of a mobile home park. And I stand to be corrected if somebody want to correct me. But when they started doing mobile home parks, there was a zoning requirement. And so they set aside a certain, you know, plot of land. And so if you had a mobile home, you knew that you can pull into this area, just pull your mobile home by your mobile home, and you've got this plot of land and you moved in, but it was zoned that way. So it was like these boundaries, or acceptable to that particular living style, right. And so when we look at the Tiny Homes, which is a little different than again, the veterans homes, the Veterans Home is like really a little small house, almost like a mobile home. But it's connected to the infrastructure. So the sewer system and everything will be able to, you know, go through our our waste system as a normal house would be. But certainly a mobile home is not something that the city has where they can, you know, place in those neighborhoods. And so I just think that, first of all, again, I'm cool with the tiny home thing, and I really wish we could find some space for it in the sixth Ward and the eighth Ward and the 15th Ward, and a ninth board. And those premium wards were having they have gotten a lot of tax abatement, and where they really built those wards up where they have middle class people, and they're living the good life compared to where I live. Okay, I really wish we could find space. But you know what, it should not be a city's problem. And we should not be the ones that feel like we're the same. We're not the Messiah of the region. We need to work with partners, we need to call out the county executive of St. Louis County and St. Charles and Franklin County and Jefferson County say, hey, look, come and work with us on this. The city of San Jose have way bigger issues than they do. And they should really be a willing partner with us in this process. So I can vote for I didn't have a problem, you know, long as I was exempt from it in the 22nd Oh, I don't have a problem where you put but you're not putting them over here. unintentional Catholics, that's not going to happen. But I also don't think because I've been to some you know, I ran city whacked out a few times. So I know why. vn square is not going to support this. I know the Central West End is not going to support this. I know parts of setsu Lord is not going to support them because they have enough. If you ask the alderman from the seventh Ward, okay, I highly doubt the 16th Ward would support this or the 12th. Ward as admirable as the ultimate from the 12th board talks, the talk. I don't think his constituents that he talks about 2000 whatever people voted in the mayor's election, I really doubt if they will be supportive of putting intentional encampments in there what I guarantee you a hair would freeze over, and he will be recalled before the 12th Ward would allow that to happen. I'm speaking out of turn. Now we know that well, I can bet you I can bet you that it ain't gonna happen. And I want to the 12th Lord alderman to prove me wrong and introduce a bill and the class and space in his wallet to do just that. So prove me wrong. I don't know how people feel in certain neighborhoods. What's your point of order?

Shane Cohn, 25th ward Alderman  2:51:17
Order is I am in no way part of this conversation or being dragged into this conversation. And I speak for this fall forward, not the alderman for 20 seconds.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  2:51:26
alderman from the 22nd can reference your ward number and say that he's challenging you to take homeless encampments that is no way infringing upon, or Britain the rules of the of the board. All of them from 22nd. Please proceed.

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  2:51:45
Thank you, Mr. President. So, again, Alderwoman. I'm with you, if you want and 10 Tiny Homes. Um, I'm gonna vote for it on this amendment, because they're not going to be put over here right now. Because we have more pressing issues in the 22nd. Ward right now than they were tiny out there in a perch. You know, people can hate lot of krewson former mayor all they want to, but put in Tiny Homes. And Jefferson, and MLK was one of the best things they could have done. It was the path of least resistance, because it wasn't right in front of a neighborhood. It wasn't in front of a neighborhood. I know. Nobody wants to give her credit. And I'm not trying to shower her with accolades. But

Christine Ingrassia, 6th ward Alderwoman  2:52:34
all I had, I had space in the sixth Ward for those spots. And she put them in Jefferson and MLK. So give her all the credit. You want to I consider her a friend of mine, but you're speaking out of turn, I've been intimately involved in the unhoused issue for at least 16 to 18 months.

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  2:52:58
Okay, so  So would you like the major amendment to make it a priority that they go in this geography that you spoke to the previous Mayor about in the sixth board? Would you be willing to ammend here and say, hey, look, I want to allocate

Christine Ingrassia, 6th ward Alderwoman  2:53:14
The wards who are interested in opting out have already done so.

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  2:53:18
But we're not talking about them. We're talking about you. You're the one that said you. you requested the previous Mayor to put it in your award. And that previous mayor said no. So I'm asking you would you be willing to amend your amendment to make it a priority that the funds go to the sixth Ward? And what neighborhood was that again? Tell us the geography if you don't mind, please. Hey, what would you tell us the geography? Where will you be recommending that they go out?

Christine Ingrassia, 6th ward Alderwoman  2:53:45
It was a place temporarily that would have worked, it's now being developed in tower Grove East. 

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  2:53:50
Oh. Oh, developed? Okay. Well, shame Shame on mercruiser is all I can say. I'm just

Christine Ingrassia, 6th ward Alderwoman  2:54:02
saying that the wards who wanted to opt out are already opted out. So let's just if you support Tiny Homes for veterans, then let me increase the funding with this amendment so that we can provide actual Tiny Homes and the support that they need.

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  2:54:22
Okay. Again, I'm not sure if you heard the lesson that I was trying to teach. So let me back up. 

Christine Ingrassia, 6th ward Alderwoman  2:54:27
I'm sure I didn't. 

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  2:54:28
Okay, so there's Tiny Homes. Tiny Homes are what you will find at Jefferson and Martin Luther King. They have no restrooms. They have no kitchen. I'm sorry, I don't want to talk over you. So go ahead. Learn from the six. Go ahead. Go ahead, alderman first. I don't want to talk over you. I want to respect you. I don't believe that's true. But go ahead. Okay, so there are Tiny Homes and I'm sorry, you feel that way, because I think I've shown you nothing but respect. And I've not really tried to talk over you when I've hit the floor. But okay, maybe I'm misunderstanding myself. So Tiny Homes are a Jefferson and MLK, they have no restrooms, they have no kitchen, they have they, they have to go outside that space. That's a tiny home. Then you have the Veterans Home, which is like a mini house, which has all the amenities of a home. There's a difference. And all I'm asking is that you acknowledge that there's a difference. Now, again, I don't have a problem supporting your amendment on the Tiny Homes, but don't mix what I'm saying with what's not true. Because if I want to support Tiny Homes, I'm supporting Tiny Homes. I'm not this does not say Bedford homes, and I let the Alderwoman for the fourth was speak on that. And the alderman from the 18th and the alderman for the 19. I've taken a Mr. President, I've taken up too much time. I know we're stretched. It's a midnight, I don't want to go to two o'clock in the morning. So I'm going to yield back my time. Thank you.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  2:56:16
Oh, thank you. All the men who else we got here? washed up. Right. Ah, all the men. I'm just gonna go top to the bottom. I don't know when everybody popped up all the men from the fifth. Thank you, Mr. President. Well, the Alderwoman from the six yield for questions and comments on from six wheel to alderman from the fifth. Well, alderman from the fifth. Please proceed. Thank you, Mr. President. I will be as concise and as quick as I can give him the lateness of the hour.

James Page, 5th ward Alderman  2:57:12
I just have a few comments. Some positive some Providence. Let's go with the positive first. Hi knowledge that the concept of intentional encampments has migrated someone the original concept pretty much was tent. So various descriptions. And in more recent times, they migrated to what can be called pallet homes. So I think that is a step up is not at the tiny home level, such as the veterans homes, but it is a step up beyond tents. My concerns are always for our unhoused citizens first and foremost. But let's get into some of my concerns. serious concerns. I've observed a number of encampments that have come and gone are especially close to the downtown area. And I won't try to repeat as much as alderman from the 22nd shared. But I firmly believe that we as a region own the homeless issue. But yeah, what I've seen is that the encampments, intentional and otherwise are concentrated in and around downtown. Another fact that I would challenge anyone to review is that the fifth Ward, the ward that I represent, already contains the lion's share of the homeless services in the city, possibly even the region, probably the region. So I am very, very concerned about voting on an amendment that deals with intentional encampments, Tiny Homes, pallet homes, however you want to describe it without some idea of placement. And I've heard a lot of opposition. It could be landmass availability, it could be land ownership. It could be all kinds of reasons but I've heard all kinds of opposition, especially south. So when I hear that unless the city is going to work diligently to Work prove that opposition, we're going to end up with more intentional encampments. How at home colonies, Tiny Homes in the north side. Now, that could be advantageous, but here's what I've seen. These intentional encampments or encampments period, never come with the necessary security. They never come with the necessary trash and refuse pick up on a regular basis, so it doesn't end up a literal garbage dump. It happens every time. So I'm gonna ask the Alderwoman from the six to tell me anything she can to inspire confidence that these intentional encampments, how at home colonies, tiny home, villages will be managed in an orderly sanitary

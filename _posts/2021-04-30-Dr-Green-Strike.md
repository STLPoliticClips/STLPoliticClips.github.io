Dr. Megan Green, Alderwoman ward 15: The General Strike in St. Louis, was a strike, if youâ€™re not aware, that brought together a multi-racial culture of workers, that brought the city to a standstill, demanding an 8 hour work day, demanding good working conditions for workers throughout our city. It scared the establishment class, the wealthy folks in our city.

They thought, how do we distract from this multi-racial coalition of workers that was forming in our city. So, what did they do? They formed the Veiled Prophet and the Veiled Prophet Ball. We see the vestiges of this today.

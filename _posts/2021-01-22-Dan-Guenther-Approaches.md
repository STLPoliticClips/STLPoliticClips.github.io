Dan Guenther, Alderman ward 9: I really just want to emphasize, we have two approaches to public safety. Are we going to through it by looking at public safety as the pandemic it is and look at it through a public health eye? Or, are we going to militarize our police department more than it already is. 

I believe there’s a large outcry from people in this city and people all over this nation to demilitarize our police forces. Here we are trying to say ‘well let’s add one more level of surveillance that is going to take care of us’.

I will yield Mr. President, I thank you for time.

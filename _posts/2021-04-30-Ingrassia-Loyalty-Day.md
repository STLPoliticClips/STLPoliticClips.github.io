Lewis Reed, President of Board of Alderman: Alderwoman from the 6th

Christine Ingrassia, Alderwoman ward 6: Thank you Mr. President, I don’t want to spend too much time on this and belabor what I think is a huge waste of our time here at the Board. This is the second time we have had something like this introduced by the Alderwoman from the 14th.

Loyalty Day is problematic for a large number of people within our community. It was designed to supplant Worker’s Day. So, I’m happy that the Alderwoman from the 15th ward is moving forward and making sure that we are recognizing that as the important day that it is. 

My other concern and then I’ll let everyone else speak, is that one of the event’s that people are being invited to Loyalty Day here in the City of St. Louis, is being hosted at the business of somebody who showed up to Washington DC and at least made it to the Capitol steps on January 6th during the Insurrection. I think that alone should make us all very weary of what Loyalty Day is actually meaning to some of the people who are moving it forward. Thank you.

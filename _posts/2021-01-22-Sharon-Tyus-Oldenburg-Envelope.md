Sharon Tyus, Alderwoman ward 1: Okay and you said, you were willing to push the envelope, is that what you said? 

Tom Oldenburg, Alderman ward 16: That’s correct.
 
Ald. Tyus: So, is it your testimony then that your board bill would be in violation of the charter?

Ald. Oldenburg: I don’t think I’d say that, I’d answer your question by saying many folks knew there would be a serious legal challenge to Obamacare. But, people believed it in their hearts and minds that it was the right piece of legislation. 

That it would accrue serious legal challenges and they did so because they believed that healthcare is a very important right to a human being and that it should be expanded to all folks, especially the most vulnerable.

Ald. Tyus:Can I stop you? We wont get very far if you try to do that with me because I’ll come right back and zone in on the question I am asking you. So you can go on and do all that false narrative comparison, it will not get you any place with me, I will keep asking you the same question.

So what part of the charter is there some concern about?

Ald. Oldenburg: Im not sure, I think you’d have to direct that question to the Alderwoman from the 6th.

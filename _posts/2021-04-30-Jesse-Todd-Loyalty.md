Jesse Todd, Alderman ward 18th: When we talk about loyalty, we talk about democracy. Black people have fought in every war since we have been over in this country. So, I don’t know of anyone, who has been more loyal than the working people, all working people. 

Especially Black people who work for free, for more than 250 years in this country and didn't get a dime. Then under segregation we were the last hired and the first fired. I don’t know, we should be having the African American Loyalty Day and this country should pay us our reparations that is due to us so that we can have some generational wealth and reinvest in our community. Thank you.

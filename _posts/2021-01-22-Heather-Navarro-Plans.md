Heather Navarro, Alderwoman ward 28: In response to the question about what plans do we have? There are plans out there. There are many plans, many recommendations that have been made. I haven't seen a single one that recommends we put spy plans -- and yes I am going to use that term because that's what they are, they are spying on us -- and put spy planes in the air to track every one’s movements in the city of St. Louis.

I think the privacy concerns, I just wanna raise the issue here that generally cameras are on public or surveilling public spaces. Or they are strategically placed to monitor who is going in and out of a particular place, they’re part of a larger strategy. The fact that these cameras are going to be capturing footage on private property I think should raise red flags for all of us.

Including private property of people who don’t even live in the city. I think that that needs to be considered. I am very curious what the liability is for data that is going to be collected on people who don/t live in the city, who live just outside of the city boundaries. Their datas going to be collected and stored by a contractor.

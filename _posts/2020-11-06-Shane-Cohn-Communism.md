Shane Cohn, Alderman ward 25: Thank you Mr. President. Thank you to my colleagues for indulging in this with me again. I want to reiterate: there is not one sentence in this resolution that mentions totalitarian regimes. Not one. It squarely focuses on the ideology of communism.

The ideology itself is not the manifestation of these criminal acts. What is, is people using that to build a totalitarian government that is not representative of the people that they serve. That is the problem with this resolution.

We have other totalitarian regimes, currently in this world, that have atrocities being committed under them that are not communists. Theyre nationalists, they are Islamist in some cases. The crux of this is that the crimes and atrocities are committed underneath totalitarian regimes. That is the problem.

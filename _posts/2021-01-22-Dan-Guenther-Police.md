Jeffrey Boyd, Alderman ward 22: Do you experience police patrolling your neighborhood with armored vehicles? Or SWAT vehicles on a regular basis, is that your experience in the 9th ward?

Dan Guenther, Alderman ward 9: I do not.

Ald. Boyd: So, what is this conversation about ‘demilitarizing the police’ all about?

Ald. Guenther: I think the Alderwoman from the 8th stated exactly what it is. You’re having a lot of surplus supplies from armed conflicts overseas that are being put back into our public police areas. Although I do not see armored vehicles patrolling the streets in the neighborhood, I have been to quite a few protests and quite a few movements throughout the city to where there are definitely not only armored vehicles, but there are also full-on body armor, military weapons deployed against the protest. So, that’s where I’m at.

Ald. Boyd: Right, so I’m going to say this, if we had a police chief that did not require police officers to wear body armor, he’d be foolish and he should be fired immediately. That’s not safe. 

I understand that if there’s a huge protest that you may see some SWAT vehicles per say, or what have you. But, I don’t think that they’re there just to present a negative force. I mean, they could be there to be helpful. The police is an agency that is there to protect people. 

Now I do understand that sometimes we have over-aggressive police officers and they handle citizens in a way that is inappropriate. I’ve been a victim of it, so I know first hand. But, it bothers me when people talk about ‘demilitarizing the police’.

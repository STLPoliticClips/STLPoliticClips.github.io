Annie Rice 45:22: I apologize to the alderman from the 21st for the late notice on pulling this off to the regular calendar. I just this looks like a significant bill for transparency for the Board of Aldermen. And so I thought it would be good just to hear in your words, what exactly we're changing here and how this will affect our operations and our transparency to the public. So if the Alderman from the 21st would yield or just respond either way,

Lewis Reed: I will ask them, I'll see if he'll yield, but it really doesn't change anything. It's the language we take up every-- Alderman from the 21st.

John-Collins Muhammad: Thank you, Mr. President. Alderwoman rice, this board bill does not change anything. This is an annual board bill that we do to be in compliance with state law under the Missouri Ethics Commission and legislation passed by the state legislator. So this doesn't change -- this is not change anything. This solidifies what we've already passed and solidifies our, our promises to stay in compliance with with with with federal law and regulation.

Annie Rice: Okay, wonderful. Thank you for that. I think there was some confusion because I know we've had discussion around changing some of our ethics and reporting. So I had gotten some questions from folks about whether this didn't change anything. So I appreciate the brief discussion, alderman. Thank you,

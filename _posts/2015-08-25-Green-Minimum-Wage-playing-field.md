Dr. Megan Green, Alderwoman ward 15: The first thing I do wanna say is that people vote, not businesses. We have gotten to a point in this country, where we have allowed businesses to be our voice. We have allowed them for too long to be voting for us.

We see that in the fact that we have the highest CEO compensation that we have seen in the history of this country. We see that in that corporations are experiencing the highest profits that they’ve had in 85 years. That income inequality we see in this country is on par with what we saw in the 1920s. 

What we’re seeing right now was the reason the Fair Labor Standards Act was passed in the first place, to try and level that playing field. To say that businesses are taking too much advantage of people and it’s time to give some power back to the people.

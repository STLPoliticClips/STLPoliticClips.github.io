Shane Cohn, Alderman ward 25: This is not only an economic imperative, it is a moral imperative, it is a health issue. There are many whereas clauses in this floor substitute, many of them deal not only with the economic issue but also the health impact that the citizens of this city are facing.

So, when we talk about the opposition here, I want to be clear. This is an economic and moral imperative for the City of St. Louis, for the region, and the state. I’ve been fighting this fight for most of my adult life. I have worked on this at the state level, it’s very difficult to get traction in a veto-proof majority.

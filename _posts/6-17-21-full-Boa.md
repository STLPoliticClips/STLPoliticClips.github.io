Thank you, Mr. President, members of the board, I just wanted to remind us that the initiative for grilles to glory is still operating. It is probably more informative now than just simply giving away food. A lot of information is there we need people to understand where they can apply for rental assistance, and any other things that are causing them unnecessary hardship in their families. So please stop at a church or send people there. There are people that to help them. And to also just simply have a moment of understanding. I'd also like to recognize that the St. Louis Symphony, Saturday we'll be providing an outdoor concert at Washington ama church. There, I'm going to send a message out to the entire board. But that is their contribution to gym teeth. And it should be playroom for anybody who wants to come. It's outside.

Pamela Boyd, 27th Ward Alder  42:13
Thank you, Mr. President. First, let me thank Brandon Bosley, because he is continuously sticking to the plate, the African American male and show that we have a lot of African American males that are looking to show our youth a different way of life. And so I appreciate him for that, because his age group is the group that we constantly say, is the problem. And so he's showing that it's not the problem and all you have to do is give a little TLC and people have come together and the youth will listen. When I did go to his his camping and fishing Derby It was very interesting because I am not an outside person. And so it I have pictures. Brandon was trying to teach the little kids how to put a worm on a hook and have this out that was so powerful. My husband was Sharon's husband, who is a country boy who loved it. And he was asking Brandon questions I never even thought about so. Thank you, Brandon Bosley. I appreciate you. I'm honored to be a colleague because you are showing that African American men are powerful in our community and their voices can be heard. They can people like you can make a difference. You send a message that we all are gone told us dope dealers and drug addicts. So thank you so much. I really am honored to know you. Oh, June the 19th. Saturday, our clergy partnership, we have a community clergy partnership on the 27th. They're going to do their cleanup. And what they have done is adopted four blocks around their churches. So this Saturday, they'll do eight blocks, because they have Bishop turns how many greater Pentecostal Reverend McKenney and hop church house ministry and they will claim from West floor sin and mimica all the way to Laura America all the way back to pork lay. So these pastors have got volunteers and they all have Ark and they're and on my Bosley is aware of our Orca because they in his Ward, and it's like drug rehab, and they have a bus that's mobile, bus free service to help our young people to get out of the truck. So I just wanted to let everybody know that and again, Brandon, you have just been Thank you all very much.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  47:16
second Oh, one from the 19th.

Brandon Bosley, 3rd ward Alderman  47:21
Mr. President, members of the board, I tell you, I got to say something about Brandon bossing you say, I'm going to give the accolades where they belong, because at the end of the day, he is showing what it takes to mold a young person. He paid attention when he was growing up. He was manageable, because you know, 

Marlene Davis, 19th ward Alderwoman  47:51
Daddy Bosley didn't play.  And that he basally he actually mentioned a lot of us. And he didn't mind taking his time. You didn't have to belong to his ward. You didn't have to even be a true politician. But he would help you, he would teach you and he would share. And so Brandon, if you continue to take those measures that he gave you, and you learn. I think you're gonna just be so wonderful. And please don't let anybody take you off that path. Because it's really about the people. You get that part of it for sure. It's really about the people. And I just wanted to give a Happy Father's Day to your dad, especially. And to you and other fathers. I just, I was so proud of

Brandon Bosley, 3rd ward Alderman  48:44
everything. You know, when you can watch somebody from when he was a toddler. And now look at you is just amazing. So thank you very much, Mr. President.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  48:57
And I want for the 19th a second all of that. You probably don't know but a lot of us watch Brandon grew up from when he was a baby. And it's his Wow. Now that all these years later we see him err on the Board of Aldermen. Most of you probably don't know. But I started out in politics as a intern and a volunteer for his father. Freeman Bosley senior when a Third Ward. So I learned politics and community engagement from him and his family. And his family has just touched so many people throughout the city of St. Louis, and it's helped people. One of the things his father used to do was if you had your water turned off, your luck to turn off or whatever he would go and work to get those things turned on. So I thought he was gonna tell you a story. I thought that he had a special in with the electric company. So I had a resident once that had their like to turn off and they needed to turn back on. So I thought to myself, I said, I know Freeman Bosley, see knows how to do that, let me call him. So I called him he got me on the phone with the electric company left the company, put the person on the payment schedule, and when they put them on a payment schedule, but here's the piece that most people don't know, if they put them on a payment schedule. They told them how much you'd have to pay down and get your electric turned back on. And all the members, we said, what time can you be at my house to pick it up, I will pay, I'll pay that down payment. So when you get there, left turn back on. So it wasn't so much magic. But he actually took his own money to get people's power and water and everything turned back on. That's how committed he was. He had never met the person before. never talked to him before anything. But I drove over his house. And he took and he went to his bank account and paid wrote a check to get that person's power turned back on. That's the kind of elected official frame boss we've seen was. And that's the footsteps that Brandon is coming up in. And that's how he was raised. So I thank you, and you're doing very, very well in picking up the mantle and keep it moving forward. And finally, I'll say this. No, you know, it's so important that we put our arms around these young African American men. And, you know, sometimes people push back on that. And they said, Well, why are you just talking about these young African American men? And why are you just putting arms around them to help stabilize their lives, because when you look at the people that are being locked up, more than not just young African American men, when you look at the majority of people that are being impacted by unemployment, overwhelmingly young African American men are the ones that are dropping out of school, more frequently young African American men console, and so forth. So it's a subset that we have not to ignore everything else. But it's a subset that we have to pay some attention to. Because it's being impacted so dramatically by every negative statistics in this nation. And every positive statistic in this nation, African American men trail and so so I appreciate and thank you for doing that and showing them the way and being at that positive role model. And that real sense. Congratulations, job. Well done. Keep up the good work.

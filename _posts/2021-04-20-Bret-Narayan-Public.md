Bret Narayan, Alderman 25th Ward: Thank you Mr. President. I’m very supportive of this amendment. I think in a representative democracy, whenever a citizen takes time out of their day to come down to city hall, we should give them 3 minutes of our time to hear them out. 

In the past, we’ve had a lot of people come on various different bills and take time out of their day to come down here to a committee hearing just to be told that they would not have an opportunity to speak. I think that this amendment would ensure that any resident of the city, or interested party, who had a stake in any given piece of legislation, would ensure that they had a chance to be heard on it. 

That’s part of what we’re supposed to do down here. We’re supposed to be down here for people to speak truth to power to. So I’m very supportive of this. I think it increases the transparency on what we’re doing down here and it holds us accountable because at the end of the day, if we have stacks and stacks of people coming saying that they feel one way about something, I think that’s something that should be taken into account when we’re making our decisions. 

To prevent people from giving their opinion to government just seems kind of, untenable, to me. It seems unamerican to me to prevent people from coming down to city hall and telling elected officials their opinion on something. So, I would encourage you all to support this amendment. Thank you Mr. President.

Matt Moak, 5:34: This reminds me of 2020. Of course, when we were faced with a similar situation where the US Treasury guide guidance was well late to the game, frankly. And so we had to make a lot of decisions early on before that guidance arrives. And this situation strikes me as very similar. Getting back to my memo, though, briefly, I think my my concern, and it remains is that the four corners of board bill two committee substitute does not explicitly meet the ARPA guidelines. And I think that's bad practice. I the idea that we house our house, okay. Well, the idea that we can, we would legislate something that on its face, does not appear to meet the guidelines. I think that's bad practice. I the idea, you know, the concept that we can come in after the fact and somehow cure that. I'm not saying it couldn't be done. But as you know, as Ted indicated, and email you just mentioned, and I saw very recently, it the best way to approach this is to outline from the very beginning, including in the board bill, how the money meets federal guidelines as we know them today.

Lewis Reed 6:56: I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry for cutting you off, but 

Matt Moak: it's okay. 

Lewis Reed: Before the board meeting starts in 15 minutes. I want to make sure we stay on point. He did not he did not state that the way you just outlined what he what he but what he did say throughout the process of administering the funds, it is in the city's best interest to make clear that the funds will be spent in accordance with federal guidelines. That's what that's that's a direct quote from from from us

Tishaura Jones: if you continue that paragraph. 

Lewis Reed: Yeah. And I'm about to I'm about to, he says for that reason, I would recommend, I would recommend that the board bill and any associated policies and contemporary contemporary contemporary contemporaneous documentation supporting the actual expenditures, all explicitly document that any funds spent on economic development are specifically intended to address then the negative economic impact on the pandemic.

Tishaura Jones 12:44: President Reed. I'm not going to belabor this point, you have a meeting that starting in a few minutes, and we have some options. We have some options. I'm speaking, we have some options that can fit. us, me. Excuse me. You're the rolling avoider. And now I'm ending this conversation as the chair of as the Chair, I am ending this conversation automatically in the conversation when I have the floor. I mean, those are the rules that we deal with. Right? If we want to later adopt a rule that gives limited amount of time for read. I'm really just trying to move things along because you have a meeting that starts in 45 minutes, and I'm about to offer you some suggestions to remedy this. Understand there. 

Lewis Reed: Nothing needs to be remedied here. 

Tishaura Jones: Yes, it does. 

Lewis Reed: Nothing needs to be remedied here. on his face. Matt Moak cannot tell me that this board bill, as it exists right now is illegal.

Tishaura Jones: Matt Moak represents the entire city as the interim city councilor, and he has provided an annual with the consultation of brown that says that these funds as they are currently worded are not not meet the legal requirements of the of the current ARPA guidelines

Lewis Reed: Can you? Can you show me where that where they're saying? Well,

Tishaura Jones: You have the memo? I'm gonna read the entire is me. Excuse me. I'm speaking. I'm going to read the entire memo. 

Lewis Reed: I've got the entire memo

Lewis Reed 17:56: Madam Mayor, look, you're gonna you're gonna railroad this thing, I get it. But I was still inquiring of the city councilor. It is in poor form for this board not to allow that discussion to reach its full conclusion because every amendment and everything that you are planning is based on the premise of of legality of the board bill. And I cannot find an attorney in town. Other than yours, your city councilor, your interim city councilor. That even comes close to saying that this board bill

Tishaura Jones: Would you like to provide those legal opinions. You said you had a legal opinion? We'd like to see it. I'm sure Matt Moke would like to see it.

Lewis Reed: And here's the thing, I don't think Matt Moke would, if pressed and and and if under oath. I don't think Matt Moak would say the board bill is illegal because the board bill is not illegal. Everyone will tell you that.

Tishaura Jones: AUDIO CUTS accusation president read.

Lewis Reed: That's the reality. That's where we're at.

Clip: Matt Moak stating again that it doesnt meet ARP guidelines

Tishaura Jones 22:44: Once again, President Reed, you're taking things out of context, and you can make it Say what you needed to say. But again, we're offering you remedies. It's not about not investing in North St. Louis, it is about investing is it is about doing it the right way. You're just trying to play or doing it the correct way.

You're not doing it the correct way. According to our attorneys, and according to our auditors, it is it is in the city's best interest. CROSS TALK I am speaking, I am speaking, it is in the city's best interest to make sure it is in the city's best interest the week to make sure that all of our language is explicit in the board bill before it passes. Because at the end of the day, like I told your staff yesterday, my name is on every report that goes to the federal government in my remarks about how we are extending these funds. And so it is my fiduciary responsibility as an elected official to uphold the US Constitution to make sure that we are doing this the right way. 
So now there is an amendment. There is an amendment that has been offered. Is there a second? The board bill gives you the ability to do that. Board bill number two as it is currently written, according to our attorneys, and according to our attorney, 

Lewis Reed: are you saying that struck the board failed the instruction the way it is right now will prevent the city from putting a program together that complies with federal guidelines?

Matt MoakNo, I'm not 

LEWIS REED POPS IN, NOT QUOTABLE

Tishaura: Let him Let him finish. Louis, let him finish. No, let him finish. No. Last point. You're taking his statement out of context. Let him finish. His no finish. No. Let him finish Mary's. He has a follow up. Let him finish.

Matt Moak: Mr. President, I'm just saying on the four corners of the document. It is not apparent that the economic development side in Section six meets arper guidelines. I think that's very bad practice.

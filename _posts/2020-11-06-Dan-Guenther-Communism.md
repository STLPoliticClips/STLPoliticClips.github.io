Lewis Reed, President of the Board of Alderman: Alderman from the 9th

Dan Guenther, Alderman ward 9: Thank you Mr. President, I was basically gonna say the same thing as the Alderwoman from the 8th. That this legislation is drafted by a right wing group. In case people haven't noticed over the last few months of a Presidential election, we’re continuously seeing people that have the Democrats, people being considered the “liberal group” or “left group”, the Democratic Party being called Communists. 

So, this is directly a way for everyone that’s sitting here putting their name on this, is saying that yes, we are going to go ahead and give more power to these groups that are going to continue to say “ohhhh these Communist liberals, these socialist liberals”. So this is exactly what you guys are putting your name on here. 

This is a resolution that was directly influenced out of ALEC. If you don’t know ALEC, look em up.

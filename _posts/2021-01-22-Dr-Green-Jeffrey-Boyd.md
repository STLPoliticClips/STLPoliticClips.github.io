Jeffrey Boyd, Alderman ward 22: So if you were going to evaluate whether or not aerial surveillance may produce a high level of efficacy to help us minimize crime, we have to start somewhere, right?

Dr. Megan Green, Alderwoman ward 15: We do, and there’s a study being done right now that is going to be released by RAND Corporation in a couple of weeks with that data. So, it seems like we should be waiting for that data and analyzing that data before we jump in ourselves.

Ald. Boyd: Right, so based on your experience and the research youve done on this, how many areas or cities are they analyzing to come up with whether or not it’s an efficient program?

Ald. Green: They’re analyzing Baltimore’s program because that is the one because that is the one thats had the longest timeframe over which they could study. 

Ald. Boyd: So, what they’re going to do is they're going to evaluate that model that was used in Baltimore and the way they employed the model, right?

Ald. Green: Yes.

Ald. Boyd: Ok, so, being a researcher, what if there were ten cities that did this? And you looked at whether or not it’s a good program. Do you think that would be helpful?

Ald. Green: It could be.

Ald. Boyd: Ok, so, judging St. Louis’ based on one city’s potential failures, does that equate to the fact that we would fail?

Ald. Green: I think that it’s a very good indication, if it’s the same program and it’s being implemented by the same person in a city that has a lot of similarities to the place where it was done. With the exception of Baltimore has a lot more street cameras then the city of St. Louis does.

Ald. Boyd: Ok.

Cori Bush, House of Representatives (MO-1): The idea, the notion, that this is not a hotel is absolutely absurd. We understand it’s not a hotel, but that does not mean that you do not treat people with dignity, respect, with basic kindness that their basic rights shouldnt be met because theyre at one of these types of institutions. 

So because of that, we will do everything we can to make sure that everybody’s rights are protected and whatever’s needed to happen, happens.

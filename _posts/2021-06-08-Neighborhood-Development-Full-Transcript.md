Madam Clerk, please call the roll. alderman Bosley. alderman Gunther aye. alderman side. All right. The woman clerk Hubbard on the woman Evans on the main page. Hi, Chairwoman Howard. President read six votes. I'm going to change the order of the board bills we're hearing since we have people just we only have speakers for one board bill. And I would like to expedite that. Give those people as much time their time first so that we can get on with things. We have two speakers, and I'm going to do board bill number eight first. Mr. Seidman. And Mr. McVeigh speaking against this bill, so if I could, are they are they both here? I see Mr. McVeigh is Mr. Seidman on. Okay. Well, then we'll just go ahead and let Mr. McVeigh speak about more. Bill number eight board bill number eight is a Would you like to introduce it? Mr. Big alderwoman. Vaccaro?

Joe Vaccaro, 23rd ward Alderman  2:50  
Yes, Board bill number eight. What it does, is, it's a 50% of the improvement tax abatement. It actually by them choosing to stay in the city, it actually increases the amount of taxes they're paying not  decreases. Not only do they pay the original taxes that pay 50% of the improvement on taxes, and then after five years, they pay the whole taxes. This is to keep a business in the city. I've only done three of these. This one, only two, this will be the third one I've ever done. It has to make it on its own merit. The so I will ask Zach and them to speak on this. I did not write the board bill. I was asked to support it. And I do. What happens is the person asking for the payment goes to sldc. They rate it not me. They actually make the decision? Whether or not it should or should not. I've had other people apply in the neighborhood that they have said no to. This one, they say yes. So I'm gonna let them speak on it since they wrote it. And, again, this what this bill does is 50% of the improvement, so they are still going to pay more taxes not less than they're paying now. It keeps jobs in the city versus people that would have left the city. They could have easily moved this business out of the city. And all the stuff I'm being accused on is a bunch of nonsense. But they want to keep that up on Facebook. That's fine. Anyway, so I would ask that. I guess it's Zach or whoever it is, is Zach Wilson on or whoever speaks on this

Aminah Wright, SLDC  4:52  
Good morning. This is Amina Ryan. I'm actually with DC and I was on what I Didn't see who was on. That's fine. Good morning, Chairwoman.

Carol Howard, 14th ward Alderwoman  5:04  
Okay, well, so I'll remember Carol, you you would like to have Amina?

Joe Vaccaro, 23rd ward Alderman  5:10  
Right. I don't know how it's judged. I don't know. Can you speak on why Shiller remember, Carol,

Aminah Wright, SLDC  5:18  
you've done, you did a very good job of explaining that the tax abatement for that one is yes, they do only pay 50%. This particular project is Margaret's daycare that's located at 3810 Watson. The developer here wants to take their existing facility and expand their business, they have an existing daycare facility here, and they simply want to expand their business. Therefore, they are demolishing one of the adjacent properties, and that they are now going to build on an addition to their existing building. With that, they submitted their application, our financial analyst Jonathan Ferry ran the numbers to see if this if this project would be adequate, and I'm sorry, adequate for tax abatement. And we did determine that five years of tax abatement at 50% would be sufficient for this particular project. They are retaining their business in the city, they are expanding their business here in the city. They are also bringing on 14, I'm sorry, about 20 new jobs. And they we think it's a very good project that is worthy of five years of tax abatement. So if there are any additional questions regarding this project, I do believe there's also a breakdown of the analysis on one of the following slides. So we are here if you have any further questions regarding the abatement for this project. 

Joe Vaccaro, 23rd ward Alderman  6:49  
Can you put the slides up there? I don't know. 

Aminah Wright, SLDC  6:52  
It should be the following slide. If we can go I'm not sure who has control of this show. But it should be via the following slide.

Joe Vaccaro, 23rd ward Alderman  7:00  
Okay, but I just want to make it clear, because what there is, these couple that are accusing me of stuff that's not accurate. 

Aminah Wright, SLDC  7:08  
Here it is. So this is the breakdown of the analysis. And this is the summary that we have here that supports the five years of tax abatement that our financial analyst has run. And and that's what we are, that we're going with the fact he was at 50%.

Joe Vaccaro, 23rd ward Alderman  7:26  
I just wanted to make it clear that this is something that's initiated from someone, not me, that all this nonsense or trying to make this out to be something that it's that it's not. This has made it on its own merit. And it's up to this board to make the decision. But it has been vetted through sldc I have no influence on it. I haven't called SLDC. I did ask this morning, if SLDC, would at least have someone here to explain how this comes about. And again, in my ward, this is the only third one that's ever even been approved by sldc. I don't know how many people have applied to sldc. But anyway, that's just the point I'm making. And so Madam Chair, I guess,

Carol Howard, 14th ward Alderwoman  8:26  
would you be willing alderman Vaccaro, would you be willing to take questions from your colleagues here? Sure. Or  should we hear the testimony first..

Joe Vaccaro, 23rd ward Alderman  8:36  
You can hear the testimony and then Okay, questions from my colleagues? 

Carol Howard, 14th ward Alderwoman  8:41  
Okay, at this time, I will hear please know that you have three minutes to speak. And I will ask the clerk to keep track of that time. And I will entertain comments from Mr. Szymen first, since he's on the agenda first. Mr. Szymen, you have the floor. Are you there? Hello, can you hear me? Now? We can.

Dan, Member of the public  9:11  
Okay, great. Thank you. Today, I'm here to speak in opposition to border bill eight as a resident of the 23rd ward. I could testify today that the construction already has already begun. I could testify that $215,000 single family home and Linwood Park is should not be blighted. I could testify of how this business is looking forward to receiving prop R funds so we're already is subsidizing this business with taxpayer money. I could testify how Alderman Vaccaro states he's only filed three of these bills in his tenure on the Board of Aldermen. It's actually over 10 if you go back and look. But that's not the important thing here. The important thing here is To realize that this if this passes the board of Alderman and this leads to, you know, we've reduces our faith in our city government, because of the appearance of a conflict of interest of what's going on here with this bill and when it was introduced 15 days after Joe Vaccaro introduced this bill, alderman Vaccaro, introduces Bill 15 days after he received a $1,000 contribution from Mark Daly, the owner and provider of Mary Margret's daycare. And that is the big deal here. You know, whether it's whether it should be blighted or not, you know, who knows whether, you know, we should be giving tax dollars to this business, who knows? The problem is, is that they gave $1,000 to Joe Vaccaro, alderman Joe Vaccaro. And 15 days later, he files this legislation. He files the bill 15 days after he received a $1,000 contribution. He only received one other $1,000 contribution from someone in that campaign cycle. And that was someone who works in concrete who's also been federally indicted. So I mean, if you look at you follow the money, where it goes on what's going on with our city, you need to realize that this, this is a problem when we have our local elected officials receiving campaign contributions. And, and those campaign contributions appear to be a conflict of interest. You know, campaign donors get a tax break at the expense of the of the children of our city, their children that go to St. Louis public schools, and that is a problem. I urge all committee members to vote against this board bill eight will result in a loss of faith in our city government. Thank you very much. 

Carol Howard, 14th ward Alderwoman  12:03  
Okay, thank you. At this time, I will hear testimony from Mr. McVeigh. Mr. McVeigh, you have three minutes. Please keep your comments to that three minute period. Madam Clerk, will you begin? Are you there, Mr. McVeigh? I'm ready. Okay. Madam Clerk begin the time. Thank you.

Blain McVeigh  12:29  
All right. Good morning, members of the committee. I'd like to thank you all and the clerk's for welcoming public comment today. My name is Blaine McVeigh and I'm here to speak in opposition to board bill number eight. I also live here in the 23rd ward. This development is near and personal to me. When I saw this legislation filed, I was curious as to what area on Watson road was in need for incentivize development or tax abatement. So I decided to walk by and was stunned to see an otherwise thriving area being described as blighted in this board bill. If you've driven our walk down Watson road, you notice home to many businesses and homes prospering side by side. And this is particularly true for this area of Watson which is just one block away from blueprint coffee and across the street from several restaurants, a dentistry and an animal hospital. Board bill a describes the property as blighted with unsanitary or unsafe conditions. illegal dumping of trash and fire hazard were cited as the main risks. But when I walked by and investigated the property on May 6, which is just six days after alderman Vaccaro filed the bill, I saw no evidence of these liabilities. There was no trash in the front of the property and the dumpsters behind the building, are maintained like any other of the buildings in the 23rd ward. The only notable difference I saw was that the windows were boarded up. And as a voter and a taxpayer in the 23rd ward. This property represents a slight nuisance but not blight. Labeling, one building boarded up with boarded up Windows as blight as an insult to the communities that suffer from real blight and disinvestment. In fact, this tax abatement only furthers the disparity in our communities by diverting 1000s of dollars from St. Louis public schools, and hundreds of dollars from our libraries, museums and Zoo boards, a developer that doesn't even live in the city of St. Louis, and doesn't care about our city enough to stay in without getting incentivize. Residents 23rd ward in the city as a whole would be worse off with the tax payment. And finally, alderman Vaccaro has boasted and aldermanic meetings at the 23rd Ward does not need tax abatements. Because investment is what is organically desired in our Ward actually agree with this sentiment and I respected him at the time for paying it. However board bill eight shows in wisdom from our alderman. One minute please my comments perfect. The building on the property has been torn down and constructions already started on the new one, which shows that the developers in this case the owners of the daycare, are not lacking capital and don't need incentives from City. So why should the city and the taxpayers and the 23rd Ward foot the bill developers who have displayed No need refunds. And with the building already torn down, where is the blight? The building is gone. So there is no longer that nuisance next door. It appears that Alderman Vaccaro, his previous assertion was right development is happening organically in this ward. And a tax abatement here is fiscally irresponsible and unnecessary. So I ask that members of this committee vote no on board bill number eight. Thank you for your time.

Carol Howard, 14th ward Alderwoman  15:27  
Thank you. At this time, I will entertain questions from the members of the committee.

Joe Vaccaro, 23rd ward Alderman  15:38  
Can you take that thing down now? I guess.

Carol Howard, 14th ward Alderwoman  15:42  
Joe, will you entertain questions from from the committee members?

Joe Vaccaro, 23rd ward Alderman  15:45  
Okay, I'm going with that thing and kind of blocks everybody out. The shared screen okay. I'm sorry. No, I can see everybody. Okay. alderman Bosley. Are you on yet? No. Okay. Um, alderman Gunther, do you have any questions?

Dan Guenther, 9th ward alderman  16:08  
Thank you, Chairwoman. I do. Um, I guess the first question is for sldc. So is Zach or Dale, who's speaking on this?

Amina? Right is Oh, no. Okay. I mean, so wonderful. Out of curiosity here, I'm looking through the

through the exhibits that you put on there. And I know that we had our list of mdna. Somebody

Carol Howard, 14th ward Alderwoman  16:35  
hold on just a minute. Hold on just a minute. We have somebody that. Thanks, everybody. Oh, whoever is got the background conversation. Go on. Please. mute your microphone. Okay, I'm sorry, alderman Gunther, it was it was really hard to hear you want to start back up a little bit? Go. I

Dan Guenther, 9th ward alderman  16:57  
will back up. Aminah, thank you. I was wondering the mdna map that we have for development and abatements? I don't see on the handout. What area this was, do you have that information?

Aminah Wright, SLDC  17:13  
So the MVA map typically applies to registered residential properties. And this is a commercial property. So technically, it wouldn't be applicable for this project. So no, we did not we did not include that information. Okay. All right.

Dan Guenther, 9th ward alderman  17:29  
And then just kind of looking at this, I guess, alderman Vaccaro. Was there any talk with the developer of not having a gigantic parking lot all the way across Watson,

Joe Vaccaro, 23rd ward Alderman  17:44  
I haven't even talked to the developer. The only time I talked to the developer, was when the people that were testifying, were harassing him, he called me. And I said, you know, because they were calling the post, they were doing Facebook and everything. And I told them, you know, it's either gonna pass or not on its own merit. And no, I hadn't. If the developer was standing next to me or two people, I couldn't even pick them out of a crowd. at all, it it's, you know, if this has just been an attack, you know, probably better than anybody from the Anheuser Busch thing. We do not write these things. People go to sldc. And since it's in my ward, I'm asked to sponsor it. I have to trust what they're saying. They've turned down more, usually. But if I get a call from sltc, asking me Well, I support the project. If it meets within the merit, of the pride of whatever they have their their rules, yes. And in my ward, that very seldom, this is only the third time that they said, this, they feel meets the merits of it. This, again, doesn't decrease the amount of taxes that this business pays, increases them. That brings 20 more employees, and this is going off what they said, I have not seen any of this yet to be honest with you, but it does keep a business in the city that would otherwise would have moved and and the assaults on me is just, you know, outrageous, but they do it anyway. If you look at all the different things, I could cure cancer, and they would, you know, figure ways to assault you know, but you know what else I could say, Dan, look at it if you feel it should pass vote yes. If you fail, it shouldn't vote. No. That's why we have committee hearings. It does bring new business and It results in higher taxes, not less taxes. And, as you know, from the Anheuser Busch thing, Anheuser Busch has plenty of money. But yet, it was one of the things that sldc must have recommended. So you brought forth a bill to do a big tax abatement for Anheuser Busch, which I'm sure is not broke. But that's not how these things work. This is brought to us by sldc. I'm sure that this, you know, this whole nonsense at 15 days before bill. I don't know how long ago was just brought in front of sldc. I don't know how this was even brought up. But I would ask maybe sldc can answer that. Hopefully that answers your questions. But I you know, overall, I generally agree that the 23rd Ward does not need to incentivize businesses, but in this case, slbc said, what I support this, that they feel that and if they call me, I will support it should be done. Okay,

Dan Guenther, 9th ward alderman  21:22  
maybe that is the question for Amina then. And since you asked it, I'll follow it up. So and maybe this would help kind of clear up some of the questions that your constituents have about the 15 days after issue. So because I know I've been working on bills before with sldc. And it's taken 18 months to come to an agreement before a bill actually gets put in. So Amina, and you know, when this was actually presented to sldc. You're on mute, Amina. Apologies. Yes,

Aminah Wright, SLDC  21:55  
I'm looking for the correct date for you right now. It's been a few months, but I will get the exact date of the bill and whatnot, when we presented the resolution to our board. So bear with me just one moment to know when it was brought to sldc start the process. And

Marlene Davis, 19th ward Alderwoman  22:13  
we want the application date. When did they apply? Yeah. Thank you, alderman Davis.

Dan Guenther, 9th ward alderman  22:22  
And then I guess my only other comment, while she's looking for that is that, you know, I did look through the entire bill. And towards the end, we you know, we have the checklist of kind of through the sustainability issues. One of the things that was checked on this project was that it was transit oriented development. But just looking at Google Maps here, it's interesting to me that Watson, which you would think would be a high transit road. And according to Google Maps, right at the corner of Watson Mar del, you even have a bus stop there. So it'd be interesting, you know, to me that they're calling this transit oriented yet, from our Dell to Linden wood is going to be all parking lot right on the street. Instead of building a new if you're going for new construction, instead of building it front and center on Watson and maybe putting some of the employee parking behind the building. Now it looks like from across the street, pa throws restaurant to counter culture restaurant, there's all parking lot. And now from lindenwood to Mar del is going to be just black asphalt all the way down. So I do find it ironic that we mark the box of this as a transit oriented development when obviously we are lining Watson with more parking lots. So. So that's mainly a comment. So but other than that, I don't have any questions on the numbers. So I will yield my time to the next person. Thank you, Chairwoman.

Joe Vaccaro, 23rd ward Alderman  23:57  
Well, I would be interested in the application date. I'm sure it's been a long time ago.

Aminah Wright, SLDC  24:03  
The application is dated January 26 2000. I'm sorry. 2021. And we presented it to our board in March of 2021 15

Joe Vaccaro, 23rd ward Alderman  24:11  
days before. Okay, they introduced they, we had I guess they introduced it at the beginning of the new session, which happens to be April.

Aminah Wright, SLDC  24:26  
Okay, we took it to the sldc. board on March 23.

Joe Vaccaro, 23rd ward Alderman  24:30  
Right, and we came into session in April. Okay. All right.

Carol Howard, 14th ward Alderwoman  24:35  
Does that answer that question? Okay. Um, I forgot that. President Reed is on on the call also. And, um, I skipped over him. Please forgive me president Reed. Any questions? 

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  24:51  
No, not at this time. I might have comments. No questions. 

Carol Howard, 14th ward Alderwoman  24:54  
Okay. Thank you. Um, then we'll move on in the order of seniority. Jessie Todd, Alderman Todd, do you have any questions?

Jesse Todd, Alderman ward 18  25:02  
Well, I have a statement. First of all, thank you, Madam Chair for recognizing me. I have to acknowledge inmate I'm almost king of development now since the fall mountain from the 17th. Left. And I do believe in automatic courtesy, but I'm concerned about the $1,000. How did about $1,000. And the reason Meccans, it raised the level of concern is because a ward reduction and this nonpartisan election, which costs a lot of money to my biggest concern, I don't want to see any older people get into trouble for pay to play in, and I don't, and I certainly don't want to sit it too. I just don't. And so that's what bothered me, besides lack of constituent services of ward reduction, but then it's going to cost a lot of money. And and I feel that the developers and other big money, people were really behind this cost more than anybody else. And so that's the concern I have. Of course, I have to say that. My question then is you got? Did you get $1,000 donation from this developer after you? How did you get it down?

Joe Vaccaro, 23rd ward Alderman  26:30  
There, first off, no, there was a $500. He has donated, this, as part of a group has has donated to my campaign. When I ran for sheriff, they've been building my campaign since forever. Now, if anyone, if you feel that's the case, I'll write them a check and send it back today. It does. And I will send the check back today. This is not about the HSE. But let me run through all of everybody that's ever donated to your campaigns. And I couldn't pick this guy out in a crowd. So to say pay per play, I'm going to look through your campaign finance stuff. And let's see who all is done any developer in your neighborhood who has supported any of your campaigns.

Jesse Todd, Alderman ward 18  27:17  
And let me ask you that, you know, I've personally financed most of my elections out of my pocket , even when I was committeman for more than 20 years volunteering I've finanaced finest all of my Never took  one fundraiser as committeman for more than 20 years, and I financed every election out of my pocket. And during this election, I just won as alderman and financed most of it out of my pocket. And I had a developer who didn't even call. He didn't make a contribution. But I didn't even meet with him during my campaign because it may have appeared. So I would just ask him a question. Okay,

Joe Vaccaro, 23rd ward Alderman  27:54  
I can tell you that I not only have not met with him, that talked about him about this development. I couldn't even tell you what he looks like. Okay, okay. I will send that I will write a check. For whatever he gave me doing this and send it back. I'm not requesting it. I just had a question because I don't want any, you know, any kind of, uh, whatever this is being brought up by some people that hate me on Facebook that are always saying negative things about me on Facebook. Okay, but I have no problem sending this check.

Carol Howard, 14th ward Alderwoman  28:33  
And I'm not as good at it. This is getting into a back and forth and we're getting out of bar here.

Joe Vaccaro, 23rd ward Alderman  28:41  
I don't know the developer had never met the developer. 

Carol Howard, 14th ward Alderwoman  28:45  
And this this is Joe you're not under oath here. Just 

Joe Vaccaro, 23rd ward Alderman  28:51  
this is part of a group that is in mass have sent me checks on every election since my very first election. And I think they've probably sent in masks to probably most of you all of them. It's just a group that always seems to be involved. 

Carol Howard, 14th ward Alderwoman  29:10  
Okay. Alderman Todd, Is that all your questions? And

Jesse Todd, Alderman ward 18  29:13  
Thank you, Madam Chair. That's all my cutting may just say missed. I missed out. On May 23. I was just asking a question. I wouldn't question your integrity. Our vote for this because of the fact that I thank you, Mr.

Joe Vaccaro, 23rd ward Alderman  29:30  
I would say Oh, four on its merit. But Kara, Madam Chair. I'm really I'm sorry. I was I was okay. Okay. first president Reed. You have the floor. Please ask your question.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  29:50  
All right. First, Thank you, Madam Chair and thanks all the members of the committee. You know, as alderman we oftentimes get attacked online for various different things, and this is no different. This isn't a 25 year 100% tax abate, this isn't a 10 year 100% tax abatement, so on so forth, right, this 50% tax abatement, this is when you look at the number of tax abatements that are given out in wards across the city. And in comparison, that what alderman from 23rd does is very, very little right. So he is not a person that gives up many tax abatements for tax incentives at all whatsoever, he has a pretty high bar within the 23rd. Ward. And I can tell you, because I've seen them operate across this entire time at the board of Alderman and, and purview to sell some of those discussions. And also, as you know, when you look at, if someone wants to bring up campaign contributions, look at, you know, $1,000, I can tell you $1,000,

you know, you know, in the in the world of campaign and campaign finance, and what it takes to run a campaign $1,000, it really

isn't gonna change the world, right. And I'm someone of all the members of Carol's means, who could afford to write his own campaign a check for 50 or $100,000. The notion that $1,000 contribution would cause him to somehow move against his morals, and the standards that he set for his personal self across these years, and just just, you know, outrageous. So, you know, I appreciate, you know, how he's operated as all the 23rd Ward, I appreciate the fact that he has worked to keep a very, very high bar within his Ward, in terms of taxes, setups. And, as he pointed out, in some of the other, all the men have already pointed out, these things make their way through sldc, and to all of our desks, and then we have to decide what to do from there. And when I was alderman of the sixth wardd, I'd go back and spend time talking with sldc getting as much background work as possible. And, you know, overwhelmingly, you know, 89% of folks wouldn't even have ever even met them before, right? Because it will come through SLDC, . And SLDC does a good job of vetting and working through those things. And then we do our part once it comes to the board of alderman. And so, you know, you know, 

Alderman Vaccaro, I appreciate the work you've done. And I'm sorry that in this new world of cancel culture, which is become chic, and the in thing to do, that they've chosen to spend time attacking you so and apologize, you know, as a resident of the city of St. Louis, that they're doing, and very, very happy to support your bill today. 

Carol Howard, 14th ward Alderwoman  33:44  
Okay, is that all? Yes, thank Thank you, Madam Chair. All right. Um, 

Joe Vaccaro, 23rd ward Alderman  33:49  
I just, I just want to say that this is the same group that makes videos because I twitch because I have a nervous condition that I take medication for that they think is hilarious. You know, it's just a constant abuse. And they know better in anyway. And I'll just keep saying over and over again. vote on it on its own merit. You're not gonna hurt my feelings on it on its own merit. That brings jobs to the city. That keeps a business in the city that could have easily moved. Just, you know, two miles down the road and out of city.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  34:31  
Okay, thank you. Um, Alderwoman Dwinderlin Evans are you on? Okay, I didn't see her to begin with. So, alderman page.

James Page, Alderman ward 5  34:51  
Just from a little bit of a different perspective. I'm always appreciate when projects not only retain businesses in the city, but also when they bring and retain jobs to and in the city. But my question is for the Alderman of the 23rd. And for Ms. Right of sldc. I'm curious to know, given that demolition has occurred, construction is apparently underway. I'm curious to know, what would be the negative if any impacts on this project should be requested incentives not be granted? Let's look at it from the other perspective.

Joe Vaccaro, 23rd ward Alderman  35:39  
You know, I don't know, to be honest with you, maybe she can answer that. I would assume that they looked at and made some agreement with the owners have this prior to tear the building down. So I don't know. Miss rice, you have?

Unknown Speaker  36:04  
To be honest, I think that answer could best be answered by our financial analysts as the financial impact this project may have if there is no abatement. I think Jonathan, Ferry if he's available, could better answer that question.

Carol Howard, 14th ward Alderwoman  36:19  
Jonathan. Are you on the call? 

Johnathon Ferry, SLDC  36:26  
Yeah, I'm here with Zach at that sldc opposite. So just I guess just the price, let you know, this analysis is actually done by my former colleague, Matt Bauer.

So I am just, I'm not completely familiar with this project. But I can go through the numbers here. I don't know, for example, what assumptions to use, but

in trying to figure out what the value of the future property would be. But it's the question just essentially, how much we would be giving up that based on math analysis looks like he's valuing the incentive at only $24,000. Over the 10 year period, or five year period, rather,

Zack Wilson, SLDC  37:25  
if the exam was taken away, what would happen? Most likely construction during the during the morville. process is not rare happens often. Because usually, we get the application months and months in advance of the actual board bill. And companies and businesses rely on our word, to tell them what exactly we can offer. So once we offer that abatement, five years, or 50, or 10 years to 95, they usually work with their bank to secure a loan. So if this abatement goes away, I don't know with this particular project, but that hurts their terms of their loan usually. So I hope that helps somewhat. I can't speak for this particular project, but that's what usually happens. 

Johnathon Ferry, SLDC  38:22  
Yeah, I mean, the one thing I can say is like, the rate of return on these projects that are basically going to be owner occupied is almost impossible to determine. Because the rate of return is based on their business operations, and not based on the real estate. So you know, a lot of these projects where the return is based on the real estate, you know, exactly what sort of like the impact is to their bottom line I we don't have enough information to know whether or not or to what extent they'd be able to absorb the extra taxes. But if the taxes are, you know, 24,000 over five years, and you're talking about $4,800 or so, a year in taxes they'd have to absorb. I think 

Dale Ruthsez, SLDC  39:09  
This is Dale Ruthesaz, I think Amina indicated that the application came in six months ago. And so the developer at that point, I mean, he obviously made a business decision. He couldn't really wait until the bill was completely approved before he demolish the existing house that was on the property. I mean, that was his decision to make. But our blighting study and and the board bill was based on a house that was on the property and and the analysis was made based on on that house and its demolition and the project involved so I don't think we can answer the question. How will it affect his his bottom line is tax abatement isn't granted. But clearly, he moved ahead with his financing and all hoping they'll clearly it's not a short thing but hoping that the 50% tax abatement would be approved. 

James Page, Alderman ward 5  40:13  
Thank you, Madam Chair, I think that I'm essentially answers my questions.

Carol Howard, 14th ward Alderwoman  40:18  
Okay. And let me now go back to my co chair. alderman Clark hover. Do you have any? My vice chair? I'm sorry? You have no questions? No questions. Okay. Um, the only thing I would like to say is that I believe that sldc has monetized most areas of the city and, and come up with some pretty fair assumptions. Um, you know, this is a daycare and, you know, we, we need to help those people that, you know, have children that need daycare.

I just think that, you know, we need to move forward with this. And at this time, I will ask the sponsor, do we want to summarize him? Sure. So, first off, it's

Joe Vaccaro, 23rd ward Alderman  41:23  
very minimal abatement, around 4000 something a year, I guess, is what I'm hearing. Which means they're paying 50%, and they're paying that much more than they're already paid. I can tell you that I had multiple complaints about that building. And as goofy as this will sound, the guy that was living in the ability said he was going to have the Russian mafia come after me. And he was with some spy agency. Men, he was gone. And then I was just first made aware of this. When sldc asked me as the Alden on that word. You know, I will say this much. If anybody feels his conflict, I will be more than happy to send back any check. I can honestly tell you, I couldn't pick him out. If there was two people in the room, and I had to pick which one was him. This came his checks, which were two checks. But that we asked for you go back, you can go back to my first campaign, this check for the was sent then he also supported me when I was running for sheriff. This usually comes from a group of people that supports me and sends checking checks in, in somewhat of a group. I would say if you feel that this is not something that warrants tax abatement, then vote against it. I personally say, you know, it's bringing 20 jobs to the city, that otherwise that there it's improving a building that whether or not you can say, You walked by it and felt it was a great building. Apparently, it had been for sale, nobody was buying it. I don't think it was the bargain of the century. I would just say up close, just vote how you feel. You know, if you feel this is a project that is so minimal, that actually instead of paying less taxes, they're paying more I personally feel that we should do that. And, and I will say if anybody feels there's a conflict, I will mail that check back today. So there is absolutely no conflict, but I can guarantee you I give you my word. I do not know. The owner of this. We have not talked about this abatement. The only thing I know about it was what was presented to me from sldc. And they asked me if I would support this. I said yes. There's been other projects that they called me and said, Joe, you know what I mean? We're someone has called me. So you vote on it on your own merit, but I'll close. I would say I would ask for favorable but you vote on it. on how you feel.

Carol Howard, 14th ward Alderwoman  44:29  
Okay, thank you. Do we have a motion to on board bill number eight. Don't move. I moved to approve board bill number eight. Move it on. Second, will the clerk please call the roll. And bazilian. alderman Gunther. alderman side. I have one o'clock copper, high are the women Evans? Age based on minimal impact on city coffers? I out a woman, Howard. Hi, Christina president, we'd see if I vote. Okay. Board Bill, thank you for a has been passed and we'll move on to the Board of Aldermen for final approval. Okay, at this time I would like to put before us board bill number seven. May I have a motion? To put board bill number seven before us.

I move that we place board bill number seven before the committee. Okay. alderman Davis alderwoman. Davis? Yes, Madam Chair. I'm ready to move forward. Okay. Do I need to take a vote on that? Put it before the committee? No, you can? You can.

Okay. alderwoman. Davis, would you like to speak to all two board bill number seven?

Marlene Davis, 19th ward Alderwoman  46:13  
Yes, I'm going to give a brief analysis on board bill number seven. This is a project in the botanical Heights neighborhood. I was excited when the company opened, and I want to say was maybe six or seven years ago. And I've watched them grow. I've watched them and heard from people in the community, how they're a part of the community. And we are seeking for a project that I'll give more detail on of 75% abatement for five years. So Godel Net company has been in the neighborhood, as I shared with you before, they currently have 90 employees, they plan to add an additional 50 employees, they're the cost of the project. To purchase the property that they want to build on is $500,000. construction cost is $675,000. We always and when I say we, I refer to we because the our neighborhood is a we. And I speak on the behalf of the neighborhood, because I share everything with it. But we currently support this project. We support this business. And I would like to have that. If there are any other additional

Carol Howard, 14th ward Alderwoman  47:51  
alderwoman you're muted. alderwoman Davis, you muted yourself. This mute is what somewhere. Yeah, go go back and repeat back it up a little bit.

Marlene Davis, 19th ward Alderwoman  48:04  
Okay, so what I'd like to do is, as the committee is asking questions, I would like to ask Zack to chime in and help with those questions. Some of them might be more technical, because as the ultimate from the 23rd shared over and over again, we don't analyze these projects. As a matter of fact, we're normally the second or third call. They everybody knows to go and apply sldc and they also know that they would need the endorsement of the alder person and the neighborhood. In many instances, we as all the persons asked for neighborhood support. So or anybody who misunderstands this, this is not a process. As far as the financial analysis that will be handled by an all the person, not by any means. I love it, I think was the best thing we ever put in place. And I am hoping that we even continue to improve upon it, because it works. It keeps the politics out of things and allows the bureaucratic system, who is hired to work on behalf of the City to make these decisions. Madam Chair, I will wait for your instructions from this point on.

Carol Howard, 14th ward Alderwoman  49:30  
Will you entertain questions at this point? Or would you like Mr. Wilson to do a presentation,

Marlene Davis, 19th ward Alderwoman  49:37  
I will allow him to make that decision if he feels like he needs to at this moment.

Zack Wilson, SLDC  49:44  
I just like to point out these jobs range from 50,000 to $150,000 a year so we were eager to keep these jobs in here in the city and to help a growing company as located and to stay in the city. Thank you very much. Okay.

Carol Howard, 14th ward Alderwoman  50:05  
older woman from the 19th. I have one question. You talked about the business, but what is it? They do? It? i? Yeah. Okay. All right at this time. I'm going to start with my vice chair. alderman alderwoman. Clark. Howard. Do you have any questions? No questions at this time. Thank you. Okay. alderman Bosley, do you have any questions? I think I don't know if he's on. Okay, alderman Gunther, do you have any questions?

Dan Guenther, 9th ward alderman  50:52  
Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. My only question, I guess it must be obvious, but this is for restoring the American car company building, correct? Yes, sir. Okay, is there a new construction and valve as well? Or is it just restoring the existing building,

Marlene Davis, 19th ward Alderwoman  51:11  
is restoring the existing building is about 90% of it. There will be some new things on the outside. But other than that, is restoration.

Dan Guenther, 9th ward alderman  51:23  
Okay, thank you. That was my only question. I've driven by that building many times. And I've always thought was pretty neat building having the American car company logo across the top. So I will be supporting this. And thank you very much. Thank you.

Carol Howard, 14th ward Alderwoman  51:38  
I'm sorry, President Reed. Do you have any questions? No questions. Okay. alderman Todd, do you have any questions? Thank you, Madam Chair. I don't have any questions. Okay. All a woman Evans, do you have any questions?

James Page, Alderman ward 5  52:08  
Thank you, Madam Chair. I will say that I am a big fan of restoration of existing and historical properties within the city. And with that, I have no further questions at this time. Thank you. Okay. All right. alderwoman. Davis, would you care to close?

Marlene Davis, 19th ward Alderwoman  52:30  
Madam Chair, I just saw alderman Bosley. Oh, yes.

Carol Howard, 14th ward Alderwoman  52:35  
alderman Bosley, do you have any questions? About alderman Davis's board bill numbers seven?

Brandon Bosley, 3rd ward Alderman  52:44  
No, ma'am. I do not. I'm having difficulties with my camera. My phone is going in and out here. So I'm trying to figure this little thing. I got a new phone a few weeks ago, my person here so apologies.

Carol Howard, 14th ward Alderwoman  52:56  
No problem. just glad you're with us. Okay. I'm seeing there are no more questions. alderwoman. Davis, would you like to close?

Marlene Davis, 19th ward Alderwoman  53:07  
Yes. Thank you very much. I have no other comments to make other than to request unanimous consent to move this out. With your vote, please. Okay,

Carol Howard, 14th ward Alderwoman  53:21  
do we have a motion? I move that we pass board bill number seven out with a do pass recommendation. Thank you. Madam Clerk, please call the roll. aldermen Bosley Gunther. I have inside out of one o'clock. I have a woman Evans on the main page. I, Chairwoman Howard. President read

seven votes for build number seven has been passed unanimously out of the Neighborhood Development Committee and we'll move on to the Florida Board of Aldermen. Thank you, everyone. Okay, the next board bill before us is board bill number 25. Sponsored by alderwoman Shuman Clark Hubbard alderwoman. Hubbard.

Shameem Clark Hubbard, 26th ward alderwoman  54:25  
Thank you Madam Chair and remember that the committee of board bill number 25. This board bill feet to approve a chapter nine redevelopment plan and blight 256 Burton Avenue redevelopment area, this board will allow for up to 10 years of tax abatement based on 95% of the assessed value of an incremental improvement. This area enclosed a former redness that was the word and that's there. That's to say the least about this residence before I will definitely open up to question is that this home this home, sits on a corner of burton and young and is highly visible is a beautiful lifestyle home that had just deteriorated in the community and turned into I mean, you will know what I mean when I say this, some won't, but I want to be honest about it, they have turned into a trap house and then a bar, a beautiful home that was historically built by Fisher, A A Fisher who's I learned it because I'm kind of historical nerd was a master developer and architect here in the city of St. Louis built numbers of beautiful homes and was known for these broken freezes. They have very ornamental, very decorative, very distinguished in but this was his personal home. And what I can say about this developer is that he took me over, he put a hard hat on my head, and in my heels, I've walked up and they've burned out home, and I could feel the energy, I could feel how beautiful it can be. And for a person like me, who probably would have rolled past it and said it needs to be demolished. Seeing his work across the city of St. Louis, seeing their work rather across the city of st louis. Not just in the twenty sixth ward but various wards, I know that the board is gonna be high, and you probably gonna break it again with this house. So I am asking for you all to support this redevelopment plan. And I will also invite you all to come over and see the work. They are doing rather, historical rehab, rehabbing these homes in this very Academy Sherman Park neighborhood is a thriving neighborhood. It's got an amazing neighborhood organization now. And with the help of the residents, and other people coming in, nobody feels you know that this is going to be a bad thing. But this block is a beautiful black beautiful house. So the pitches that we have on the handout, they don't do it any justice. Now, I said I was gonna post a picture on Twitter what it looks like now because they've completely taken the roof off, they're gonna build it with limestone. I'm lifting brick by brick the limestone by limestone, and I'm excited to support this project. And I know we have SLDC on here, and they'll be able to Ms Amina Wright will be able to answer any questions that you might have that I can't answer. But clearly see, I would love to have you all support on a board deal number 25.

Carol Howard, 14th ward Alderwoman  57:19  
Thank you all the woman at this time, will you entertain questions from the committee? Okay, all right. Um, we will start with President Reed. President Ray Do you have any questions?

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  57:36  
No questions ust want to thank to the alderwoman for working to bring a what really sounds like an exciting project to us. She did a wonderful job of painting the picture for us. I felt like I could I was walking through it with

Carol Howard, 14th ward Alderwoman  58:02

Carol Howard, 14th ward Alderwoman  59:57  
Okay. Um, I would also like to say I missed you said that there was an architect. Did you name the architect of this building that did quite a bit of planning in the city? alderman Hubbard. Yeah. What was it? What is his name?

Shameem Clark Hubbard, 26th ward alderwoman  1:00:17

But we need a second first again. Okay. And previous previous row. Okay. All right now we move on. I am not going to hear board Bill 50.

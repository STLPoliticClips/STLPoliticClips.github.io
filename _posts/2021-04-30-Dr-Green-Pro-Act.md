Dr. Megan Green, Alderwoman ward 15: I think that we are seeing a lot of pushback, a lot of Red Scare tactics that are happening today in our country, as a result of the gains that are happening in the labor movement right now. 

We are on the precipice of perhaps passing the PRO ACT, which would be the greatest expansion of the labor movement that our country has seen in my lifetime. Thatâ€™s exciting because workers in our country deserve that.

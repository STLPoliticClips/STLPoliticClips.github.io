Cara Spencer, Alderwoman ward 20: The beauty of the amendment that the Alderman from the 24th has just offered is that it’s simply an amendment that eliminates the budget for the Workhouse. It does not reallocate it. That money therefore then goes into the General Fund. 

If the Mayor, or whomever determines that we have to finish out any contracts, that we are obligated to do that, we’re free to do that. Those funds are unencumbered by this amendment and we can continue to operate within what would be --- determined to be legal obligations on the part of the City of St. Louis. 

I’m happy to answer any other questions regarding the contracts. I believe all 7 contracts were shared with Ways and Means. I really have to commend the Alderman from the 24th for introducing the amendment here to the budget that I was not even able to offer with my colleagues in the Ways and Means committee during last week.

Bret Narayan, Alderman 24th ward: But I'm also just concerned about a look of some some hypocrisy. We have kids at school, courts are open, Busch Stadium is at 100% capacity with no masks required. The grocery stores are open, no masks required, bars and restaurants have been open, no masks required. 

At this point, basically, anyone who wants to get a vaccine has been able to. We've had, you know, some massive events and we've had great responses to those events. But if all of these events can happen and people are walking around the city, not wearing masks or mask requirements, gone, the social distancing requirements gone, we're following CDC guidelines. 

We've said for 18 months now, you know, we need to follow the science on this and the CDC has put forward their guidance, I think that we should follow it. And you know, now that they're saying it's safe to open things back up, I think we need to open back up in the government as well. 

If all these events can happen, then the legislative branch of government should be able to operate with masks and social distancing. I believe that would be above and beyond CDC guidelines for the moment.

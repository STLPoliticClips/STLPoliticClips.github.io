Sharon Tyus, Alderwoman ward 1: Point of order

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman: Alderwoman please state your point of order

Ald. Tyus: I was trying to do this back when you thought I was still continuing about the courtesy resolution. It is my understanding that in order to vote, on a Zoom meeting, your actual face, not your picture, has to be shown. So, in that case, the people such as Alderman Collis Muhammad, could not vote. I think that we should give them a chance to come on board so he can vote. But he can not vote with a picture, he has to vote with his face. We hae to be physically present for a Zoom meeting

Pres. Reed: Alderwoman, the vote has been called on that issue, so that vote has been called.

Ald. Tyus: He can not vote and 

[inaudible cross-talk]

Ald. Tyus: We can not vote if there is not a person, that’s like voting off of the floor.

Pres. Reed: Alderwoman, we have

Ald. Tyus: The vote can be -- it’s not final, he can not vote off of the committee, he has to be… fine, you can do it, it’s still incorrect.

Pres. Reed: That vote is final. People have -- well anyway.

[inaudible cross-talk]

Ald. Tyus: Mr. President when would you then bring it up? If I can’t bring it up in the middle of the vote. He can come and leave. So, this is the appropriate time to bring it up. My hand was up immediately afterwards. The appropriate time to bring it up is when this had been done. 

Now he’s here, I think he should be given a chance. I didn’t say he shouldn't be voting. I just said his face was not present, that was what I said. Here he is, now let him vote.

Pres. Reed: He’s already voted, Alderwoman.

Ald. Tyus: No he didn’t, he was not a present. You can not vote off the floor. 

Pres. Reed: Alderwoman, he was present, he already voted.

[inaudible cross-talk]

Ald. Tyus: He did not. He was not his picture. When you look at this, you’re gunna see his picture was up there. I’m only trying to make sure that we follow our rules.

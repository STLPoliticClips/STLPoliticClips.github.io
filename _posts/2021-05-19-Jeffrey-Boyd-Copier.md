Jeffrey Boyd, Alderman Ward 22: I was wondering if the board of aldermen was going to catch up with other offices by having a color copier, so that we can make better presentations to the public? I’ve only been asking for a decade. For some reason, we’ve been reduced to just old Brother copier machines that take like 2 minutes to print a copy.

Tom Shepard, Chief of Staff to the President of the Board of Alderman: I would say I can talk to the clerk and let’s get that ordered. We probably have some money available. It’s a little late in this year to transfer money, but it’s possible we have some money available. I know we have. I know we have had some available in our total budget, because of some vacancies we have. So, I can try to get that done this year. Or, we could add some money to our budget in order to make sure we can do that.

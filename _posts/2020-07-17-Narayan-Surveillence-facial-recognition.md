Bret Narayan, Alderman ward 24: At a time when we’re discussing Persistent Aerial Surveillance, and we know things like facial recognition technology is just right on the horizon -- we’ve seen it implemented in other countries as Alderman Roddy so eloquently pointed out. At a time when we are discussing these things, we simply must have a mechanism for oversight of these technologies and to allow the citizenry to say what is acceptable and what is not acceptable to them

Remember this is their government, not ours. This is their government.

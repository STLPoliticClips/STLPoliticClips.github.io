Tom Oldenburg, Alderman ward 16: [The city councilor] further went on to say that the power rests with the mayor and the executive to do such a process. Which I respond with that I'm not all surprised by the mayor’s attorney that the mayor has the sole power to do any contracting.

Sharon Tyus, Alderwoman ward 1: Well, I will first stop you the city councilor is not the mayor’s attorney, that’s the first thing you need to know. The city councilor is our attorney and many other departments, they’re not the mayor’s attorney. In fact I’ve hard Michael Garvins say it many times on record, when he gets before me and I always ask him -- that’s one of the questions I ask him-- and he always laughs because he knows im going to ask him that.

The city councilor is not the mayor’s attorney.

In fact, there’s a Supreme Court case that goes all the way to the President of the United States when Bill Clinton was the President trying to claim some kind of privilege between some federal attorneys and the Supreme Court told him those attorneys do not work for him, they work for the federal government. It went down to the state and local level.

So, city councillors are not the mayor’s attorney. So, I want to get that straight, okay?

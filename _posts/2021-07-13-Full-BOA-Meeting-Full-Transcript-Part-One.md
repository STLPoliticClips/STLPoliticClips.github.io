Second, seconded by all the ones from the 19th and some others, I miss alderman from 22nd. You recognized

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  13:33
Yes, Mr. President, as well, thank you. There's been a lot of hard work that's gone into this board bill, the first allocation of the recovery funds to help St. Louis become a better St. Louis. I think we had a very fair process. The committee took its time to really make sure that the voices of the citizens and businesses within our city were heard. There are a lot of great recommendations that were included in the substitute. I did my job to reach out to my colleagues. I know it was short notice, but we only had a couple weeks to deal with this to make sure that it was an inclusive process where they were able to offer recommendations on things they disagree with, and initiatives that they may want to see in this bill. Here's what's exciting about this bill, and I know there's been a lot of chatter, but this is only the beginning of a lot of good news for the city of St. Louis. And I want to be helpful that you know, we don't get bogged down into fighting over, you know, things that we can work out over the summer break. I'm excited about money being able to North St. Louis, I'm excited about the core doors. It's time that North St. Louis get I'm not ashamed to say more than his fair share of investment. We have communities, commercial corridors along MLK West floors at Grand and Natural Bridge that have had years of disinvestment, and it's time that we can start writing some wrongs with these federal dollars. I'm excited about Home Repair opportunities, there's almost 1000 people on the Home Repair waiting list $15 million will go a long way to basically wipe that list off. And we should also market encourage our constituents to put their name on that list. There are a lot of senior citizens that are in desperate need of help meeting new roofs and new porches and gutters and tuckpointing that don't know about the healthy home repair program. And it's our time to really reach out and help our constituents. This is not of course, a perfect bill. But again, this is just the beginning, Mr. President, and I'll take whatever questions I have on my colleagues, and I know there are some amendments to be offered. I have a couple of minutes myself, but I'm ready to start the dialogue.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  15:49
Thank you. Any discussion and discussion? alderman from the 20/25.

Shane Cohn, 25th ward Alderman  16:04
I thank you, Mr. President, I would this be the time that I can offer an amendment when we're talking about the board of elections? Yes, sure. Okay. Well, first of all, I do want to take the opportunity to thank yourself and the chair for your time over the last week, two weeks, really, and putting this bill together. You know, as someone who serves on HUDs, also, the committee and my colleagues that serve on that committee for all of the hard work effort and time, that has been put into the the hearing process and hearing the bill and the almost, I think six hour long meeting that we had before dealing with the amendments in committee. And so I really want to thank everyone for their time and effort. To make this a better bill. I would like to introduce the the first amendment that I have for the bill, I actually did bring this up in committee and withdrew it at the request of the chair and the president, so that we could have some further discussions around it, which we did. Last, I think it was Thursday, if I'm not mistaken, the days are all bleeding together, because they never seem to stop. But it'll be amendment number one, which I believe is in the Google Drive for everyone.  This is an amendment to update our elections infrastructure, to be prepared in the event of another pandemic, and also be prepared to modernize the way we administer elections in the city of St. Louis. Currently, the board of elections, their equipment is nearly 20 years old. So you know, that is think the alderman from the seventh Ward pointed out in the committee hearing last week, probably older than any of us have any electronic equipment in our houses. And currently. And actually, the board of elections for the city of St. Louis has actually been borrowing equipment to keep operating our elections locally, which is completely unacceptable, especially in times when we do have emergencies that arise or pandemic that we're currently experiencing. One of the examples that was brought up in the conversation that the chair and the President and I had with the Board of Elections last week was even during this, you know, previous elections, we had a situation where a car drove into a polling place. And we had to shut down the polling place and redirect traffic from there. This system that we're evaluating would actually allow people and the board of elections to move our voters around in a more agile function so that they can cast their ballots and be engaged citizens, just as we would like for them to be. and so the amendment is for $5 million. roughly about 3 million of that is for the actual capital expenditures themselves. And then there's additional funds that would need be needed for training of staff, volunteers, software enhancements, and IT infrastructure to support the new the new equipment. So the total cost is four, 5 million.  And I will entertain any questions with respect to amendment number one,

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  19:39
right Oh, alderman from the 24th all the way from the 24th your hand and alderman from 25th bofi. All came up at same time. So I don't know if yours is a question for you, or just in general.

Bret Narayan, 24th Ward Alderman  19:56
I also have an amendment to offer. I apologize. I got when he called on me cuz I was like, wait a minute I didn't write.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  20:03
All right, well, well, I'll make note of that and call you directly after we finished with thank you all one from the 19th.

Marlene Davis, Alderwoman ward 19  20:14
Thank you, Mr. President, members of the board, I just wanted to have a few comments in supporting this amendment. We know what we went through during the pandemic, by reducing the number of voting sites in order to try to have safety for people, which also gave us lower numbers coming out to vote, because people had to go so for some didn't have transportation and or didn't realize that we were trying to provide transportation, it was rather cumbersome. So I'm glad that the alderman from the 25th paid attention to this need. And I'm hoping that we all have an opportunity to support it. And while I'm speaking just very briefly, I want to thank everybody for all the work that we have had. We have done in the last two weeks. It is incredible. And and we couldn't have done what we did, if we had not had the mayor's special commission work on it previously. And as I looked at the members that are on there, probably over half of them, well, no more than half. They know me directly. We've worked together over the years. And I respect them and their opinions. And and I'm sure that they respect us as well. So as we move forward, I think we have an opportunity to continue to work in the best interest of our kids, our city, not just one individual neighborhood, but our city as a whole. I've seen a lot of press that talks about 2500 responses, that is admirable. But we also have to remember that each of us who sit at the Board of Aldermen, was the legislative body that does the appropriations, each one of us do represent about 11,000 people. So when you look at that as a whole, we want to continue to engage the public, let's get even stronger in doing that. And making sure that we have a lot of input us what we've done thus far. We can accept that I think we're going to be able to do even more as we move forward. Again, thank you for everyone. All the work that they've done. And done, Mr. President. Great, thank

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  22:37
you. All the woman from 19 Alderwoman from the seventh. 

Jack Coatar, 7th ward Alderman  22:46
Thank you, Mr. President, members, the board. Just to be clear, while we right now we're talking about the alderman the 25th selection event is still around. Yes, yes. Okay, sorry, my connection is a little spotty. I'll be brief. I just want to say I appreciate the 25th working on this and being patient and working with the committee and the election board, I rise and total support of this amendment to get some much needed technological upgrades and staff training for the election board to bring us into modern times and to make them more nimble and able to adjust to whatever crises there are that day, whether it's a car, election building, or a natural disaster or a pandemic. they desperately need this new equipment. I think the alderman the 25th use my line that yes, equipment is 2020 plus years old. I mean, no one in their right mind would be relying on 20 plus year old, you know, computer technology to run their day to day lives. And we shouldn't be using it for our elections. So I hope this amendment passes, and we can move on and and swiftly get through this meeting. Thank you.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  23:50
Right. Thank you. Ah, Alderwoman from the 28th.

Heather Navarro, 28th ward Alderwoman  23:57
Thank you, Mr. President, I want to express my support for this amendment. And I appreciate all the background work that was done on this by the alderman from the 25th. I just think it's so important with the funds that we have here that in 5 - 10 years, we can point to something and say, This is how we invested the stimulus funds in order to improve systems for the improvement of the lives of our citizens. And I think that this is an exact example that that does that it's an it's a real investment in systems that are going to make a change for our city that we will be feeling long into the future. So thank you, alderman for the 25th and I support this amendment wholeheartedly.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  24:35
All right, thank you all the ones from the 28th. Any further discussion, Any further discussion? All in from the 25th you're recognized to close on amendment number one.

Shane Cohn, 25th ward Alderman  24:46
I, my colleague from the 24th houses hands up I'm not sure if that's

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  24:50
no. Or Yes, I'm just thinking popped up at the same time earlier. So yeah,

Shane Cohn, 25th ward Alderman  24:57
I thank you. So I I'd just like to close by thanking everyone for their kind comments. You know, this has been an effort that has been roughly about a year of conversations and planning on the, on my part. And with the board of election, certainly, they've done a ton of work. This is really just an awesome opportunity as my colleague from the 28th Ward, you know, reference to modernize our systems and provide a direct impact to our voters in terms of how they experience the ballot box and the polling places. And so, really appreciate everyone's support. And with that, I asked for your favorable consideration on amendment number one.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  25:41
All right, thank you. It's been moved out. Well, all of them from the 25th. Sorry, I need a motion.

Shane Cohn, 25th ward Alderman  25:48
No, I moved to adopt amendment number one to board bill number 226.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  25:52
saying about all the ones on the 19th that we adopt amendment number one, for Bill number two committee substitute as amended. VOTE BEING TAKEN All in favor signify by saying aye. 

26:08
Aye. 

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  26:11
Opposed? Motion carries. Madam Clerk, please make note of the adoption of amendment number one, all the way from the 24th.

Bret Narayan, 24th Ward Alderman  26:24
Thank you, Mr. President. I'd like to introduce amendment number 14 in the drive relating to severability.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  26:36
He said commandment number 14. Yes, sir. 1414. Okay. Please proceed.

Bret Narayan, 24th Ward Alderman  26:46
So this is one that, you know, we went over in committee and I got this wrong in committee. This relates to the severability clause here in committee when we removed the severability clause from the bill. I thought that we were removing a superfluous severability clause, a second severability clause and in legislation of this size, with this sort of impact on the city. I think it's absolutely necessary from a legislative and legal standpoint that we have a severability clause here. We know that we're we're tinkering on the margins on what we can do with this money. And I'm supportive of the development in the development language in there. You know, I know that we have the opt out clause regarding the intentional encampments, which, you know, we've had some some questions on the constitutionality of it. So ultimately, if a court were to if this were to be challenged at any point and a court were to strike down, say the opt out clause or the development in corridors is not something that we could do with this money, or the constitutionality of the opt out clause, if a court struck that down, that they could end up striking down the whole bill, without the severability clause. So this just gives us a little bit of certainty moving forward that if anything that we're doing, gets challenged in court that no court can kind of undo all of the work that has gone into this, from from this board from the mayor's office and from the general public. This doesn't change anything substantive in the bail, it just kind of gives us an extra layer of protection. And with that, I would move to adopt amendment 14 to board bill to committee substitute sagen

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  28:48
has been moved by alderman from the 24th. Seconded by the alderman from the mind. All one Snaith.

Annie Rice, 8th ward Alderwoman  29:03
Thank you, Mr. President, members of board I rise in support of this amendment. I think it is it is prudent of us if severability clauses are pretty standard, in a lot of the legislation that it comes in front of us, particularly when we're dealing with multiple departments, and especially as this is new Treasury guidance is coming out nearly weekly on what we're allowed to do with this money and what we aren't. And I think, reiterating what the alderman from the 24th side, just extra layers of protection are for all of our benefits and for the protection of our citizens so that we don't end up having to come back and read redo this whole bill, or, God forbid, take money away. So I I would absolutely ask for my colleagues favorable consideration of this amendment.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  29:49
Right. Thank you. Any further discussion? Any further discussion? All my friends 22nd.

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  29:58
Thank you, Mr. President. board, I clearly understand what some of my colleagues are, are concerned about. But I do believe that if there's something in the bill that is challenged in court, then we can just amend our ordinance to make sure that we comply. And I'll just be honest with you, I can't and I have some anxieties about how people interpret the uses of these funds. And I'm concerned that if there's an allocation of funds, for example, in North St. Louis, that we come up with these legal opinions that says, Well, we can't use those funds for North St. Louis. So it's, it's, you know, it's all or nothing, you know, all this needs to be done in a package. And if we're out of compliance, and we get sued, which I highly doubt, then we'll just take it out. But right now, I'm concerned about, you know, the heavy handedness, you know, that the ball has been treated. And I just rather have an all or nothing package, you know, if the mayor doesn't like it then vetoed, but I am concerned about things being taken out of this bill, because someone found a legal maneuver to say that it's not appropriate. So that's where I stand on that.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  31:16
Right, thank you, alderman for the 23rd. 

Joe Vaccaro, 23rd ward Alderman  31:20
I also have concerns that board of E&A can then change anything or everything that they want. I know the Alderwoman shaking her head no, but I'm saying what I believe, I believe in Mr. President, or if, if someone's here, they can tell me otherwise. But I think when this goes over, they can actually take things out or are have the city attorney to say this. Is that right? Oh, no, I do have concerns about putting this back in. And while I know I see people shaking their heads, no, but I still have the right to voice my opinion. And so that's all I'm doing. All right. 

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  32:09
Thank you all the one from the 14th.

Carol Howard, 14th ward Alderwoman  32:13
I agree with what has been said by the alderman from the 22nd. And the 25th. I think that, you know, by putting this in there, it allows a pick and choose sort of cafeteria style enactment of this board bill number as amended for Bill number two. And I, you know, had my input on this. And I think that, you know, we as a board work together across the city, to provide some guidance on the use of these funds. And I think that it should stand as it is. And if it's found to be a legal defense, we'll make sure we don't spend the money. This has happened over it's the St. Louis Development Corporation, we've been found, you know, I'm not in compliance, and they just don't allow us the spending. So I really think that by putting this in there, it allows a cafeteria style implementation of the law. And we've put it together. And I think it should sit stay as it is. Thank you very much. That's all.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  33:17
Thank you. All the way from the six.

Christine Ingrassia, 6th ward Alderwoman  33:22
Thank you, Mr. President, I just wanted to rise in support of this amendment. I think it's incredibly important. I looked back at a number of ordinances over the years and could not find any bill that we've passed out of here with multiple iterations that are listed, especially in funding bills that does not have a severability clause. And I want to make sure my colleagues are very clear. And understanding this is not something that the federal government is going to tell us we are not allowed to do. We're going to spend the money and then turn in the information on what the money is spent on. And so we're gonna owe the money if we spend it incorrectly. And so having a severability clause in place, protects the remainder of the funds instead of killing the entire piece of legislation. And we won't get sued on it, probably I mean, the federal government is not going to sue us. They're just going to tell us to give, give their money back if it's spent in appropriately. And so I think the conversation about this being an effort by the mayor's office, or whoever else to pick and choose what they want to spend the money on is absolutely an inaccurate argument. It doesn't have legs. What severability clause does is protect the remainder of the bill if a portion of it or multiple portions of it are found to be not in adherence with the federal guidelines that I have read from the Treasury and agree that there are a couple of problematic areas in the committee substitute as amended. Thank you.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  34:51
Thank you all the one from the first The one from the first is connecting audio and right now and you're connected, you should be connected now. No, it still didn't come through. Okay. All right. All the men from the 18th Act, Mr. President, thank you.

Jesse Todd, 18th ward Alderman  35:33
We have all of it from a teeth rather supported this amendment. We have two minutes to important to our take a risk on making for one rule. We legally had a whole build out go back to committee. Also, we had this healthy heart We have healthy home program 1000 we have three we have many that we are given to work with, we have so many things that this deal can cover. So the survivability cloud over if we overspend, then we have to change the budget. And with this COVID-19 and many other businesses both and I've worked in full, full capacity, we stand a chance of having to cut other program in order to send it back to the government. What order Mr. President? Yes, please state your point of order. I just can't hear Alderman Todd I've not been able to hear him since it started.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  36:54
He's been fading in and out if you turn your volume all the way up, you can hear him I can hear him with my volume all the way up.

Christine Ingrassia, 6th ward Alderwoman  37:04
All the way up. Todd, we're gonna Aeneas to and I can't hear you, Alderman.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  37:12
Todd, I your your your colleagues said that they cannot hear you so we're gonna move on. Um, but you know, thank you for for for for trying to express your views. A further discussion Any further discussion? Further discussion? All along from the eighth

Annie Rice, 8th ward Alderwoman  37:39
to the board. I am hopeful that there we go. The Alderwoman from the first is backup. I will defer to her if that is okay. Since she's I've already spoken once.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  37:49
On from the first please proceed. Hello. Yeah.

Sharon Tyus, 1st ward Alderwoman  37:59
Yeah, okay. Okay, I'm sorry. I'm out of town had planned before this. I just want to address the alderman from the 23rd concern want up? First of all, Board of DNA can not change what we do. So same thing? Is that me?

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  38:19
Once you turn the volume down on your turn, down, computer, I'm going to try something else. Hello? Oh, yeah, that's perfect.

Sharon Tyus, 1st ward Alderwoman  38:46
Okay, um, the Board of DNA can not change what we do without sending it back to the Board of alderman. So that's just not true. If they've done it in the past, we let them get away with it. But that is not what they're allowed to do. But people will do whatever they want. If you let them get let them get away with it. I am quite surprised that this board bill did not have a severability clause. The alderman from the 22nd Express. He said, Well, it's all enough. And that's okay if he believes that. But if you don't believe that, if you want some of the things to be left in, in case something struck down, then it is important that you have a severability clause in there. It's always good to put in there because of course sometimes we do put do things that would that are not legal and declared illegal. And in fact, if that happens, or if we go to court or somebody challenges, any portion of this, it's all or nothing, there is no parts and picks that you can do. Now the mayor does have some other things that you all have not considered and I'm not going to say because I do believe that the Board of alderman is an oversight committee and it is up to us to make sure everything's financially safe. Sound and I've pushed for this for years when we let a whole bunch of things go by that we should not have. So I don't have a problem with us doing our duty. I hope we do it all the time with every mayor, this is my sixth mayor. But I do I do want to caution you that there are some tools that the mayor has at her disposal, and you may not be able, you may not find that you've done what you want it to do. So I would caution you to say, on the side of caution, I would I'm going to support this amendment. And then if you don't, if then you find out that there's some things you don't know, because you haven't been around long enough to see them happen. I think a lot of you all will be surprised that Hong Kong to that issue was warranted and needed. And if you don't do that, it's fine. If you want all or nothing, that's fine. But oftentimes what you think you can get us all enough, nothing. If you read our charter, there's some other outs to that. So with that I am going to support this amendment. And I may ask for a roll call.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  41:09
Thank you. Alderwoman from the eighth.

Annie Rice, 8th ward Alderwoman  41:12
Thank you, Mr. President. And I just I do also want to speak briefly to I did a quick check of a number of bills that were introduced this session. And it's generally when we're accepting grant funding, we're accepting funding from outside the city of St. Louis, with these severability clauses are really important. One of which was the victims in the witness protection program grant, the alderman from the 23rd introduced him as past that had a severability clause. And also board bill number 82. That would be the next round of American rescue Act, or American rescue plan. funding from yourself. President Reid also has a severability clause currently included. So do you think this is is standard practice? I think this is best practice for the board. And I would encourage my colleagues to support this amendment.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  42:00
All of them from the 18th. 

Jesse Todd, 18th ward Alderman  42:10
Thank you, Mr. President. Can you hear me? I asked, rather than supported as Bill, because we had in case part of it is ruled. Cast constitutional. I don't want all of the money. I don't want the whole bill that had to go through the whole process. And we lose this bill because we had too many benefits for our citizens. They helped the Home program vaccine you we have streets, and many other programs that are that our citizens need. And I think that we need an AI rather than support on it. Thank you, Mr. President. And thank you, both our two people.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  42:53
Right. Thank you, alderman for the 22nd. 

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  42:58
Thank you Mister President the members of board I like to ask if the alderman from the first video for question. 

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  43:04
Oh, one from the first radio for questioning and alderman from the 22nd? 

Sharon Tyus, 1st ward Alderwoman  43:13
Yes, always.

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  43:17
Thank you Alderwoman. Tapping into your legal expertise and your years of service at the Board of Aldermen. The severability clause, it your understanding that only the courts can find that sections of the ordinance are not constitutional.

Sharon Tyus, 1st ward Alderwoman  43:39
might also come back. You know, in the years that I've been here, we've had to give back HUD money on probably[inaudible] occasions I can. In fact, when I came back here and 13 they gave us a list of 11 that we had had to do recently, but I can probably remember 15 or more. So the courts can say it's not legal, but it also can come in and rule which is more harsh than the court sometimes because it's their money and they can really make us pay it back. And we have had to do it. We had to do Park Plaza and other things.

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  44:18
Right. And I would understand that because you know, they were the grand tour. So we definitely want to make sure that we do be in compliance if the Grand Tour rules that they don't like the way we've set it up. So let me ask you this. So is it your opinion that the American not arbitrarily sever clauses within the ordinance with the legal opinion?

Sharon Tyus, 1st ward Alderwoman  44:40
My opinion and I don't want it I'm not going to discuss that any further because I'm not going to tell the mayor or you What else can be done at this. Okay. Um, I do believe that women should have oversight and you all have heard me say this for many years. I wish those last five sir with we had I don't have a problem with the board flexing their power and saying we agree with this or not. But I'm not going to give you an opinion that the mayor doesn't have some other options cuz she does. Okay. Well, that's not what I'm asking. I was just asking your opinion. What I'm saying is, in my opinion, she does various things that she can do. That's what I'm telling you when I say it out. You are.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  45:25
Thank you online. I appreciate it. No further questions. Anything further, all within 20 seconds. 

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  45:39
No, Mr. President, thank you. 

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  45:41
Any further discussion, Any further discussion? Any further discussion on amendment number 14? Going once going twice? alderman from the 14th. Do you have anything further? I mean, no, no. 24th.

Bret Narayan, 24th Ward Alderman  46:09
Thank you, Mr. President. Just want to restate the importance of a severability clause on on a piece of legislation of this size, there's too much work that's gone into this to let any individual or entity who puts forward any legal challenge have the risk of striking down the entire board bill language here. Again, this doesn't change anything substantive. With with in regard to the bill. We have a memo from the city councilors office that the mayor and he and he can't just tinker with this. After it comes through the board based on this severability clause. This would be to prevent the judiciary from striking down the bill as a whole. I think that it's it's prudent to put this in. I know it was in and it got removed and committee. And again, I wish I had that vote back because I thought we were removing a secondary clause. So I'm attempting to put it back in now. And I would hope for all your favorable support. This is not a a meaningful, substantive change to any of the language in the bill or what the bill does. This only gives us an extra layer of protection. And with that, I ask for your favorable support and move to adopt amendment 14 to board bill to committee substitute.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  47:47
I didn't recognize you to close I just you'll be able to do that. And then it because I had some notes that people were still trying to connect them having problem for two hands going up. So I'm all the men from the seventh.

Jack Coatar, 7th ward Alderman  48:07
Thank you, Mr. President. Members, the board. Can you hear me? Yes. Okay. Okay. Sorry, my connections a bit spotty today. Um, you know,  as a general rule of thumb, I think several ability clauses are a good thing in legislation. My concern here and I don't remember why it's such a marathon meeting the other day. I don't remember if I offered this amendment or if the President did. But my main concern here is the level of coordination we've we've currently seen between the current administration and some of these outside entities, these legal entities in particular, you know, that the court themselves to be public interest law firms. I'm worried we can find ourselves in a scenario where they're getting try to use the courts to invalidate you know, the provisions of this law that the Board of Aldermen have put in here that room 200 doesn't like, I mean, I think this is a real fear, we could find ourselves in a scenario where we passed this today with the severability clause, you know, somebody file shoots trying to invalidate you know, various provisions, whether it's the the various economic development zones in the north side or additional funds for police overtime. And the next thing you know, the city is basically consenting to the relief that that these plaintiffs are asking for and the current mayor controls the city councilors office and I think this is a real concern. Maybe that's not their legal strategy and maybe I just gave them that strategy in this meeting, but it's a concern of mine and and the level of trust that I have right now and how negotiations have gone forward in this process and how we The board has been vilified for doing its its its role in a charter city and being the appropriated funds and and the fiscal watchdog. It concerns me so I'm going to vote against the the alderman from the 24th amendments, assuming I have a good connection to do. So. Thank you.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  49:59
Thank you. men from the 21st. Thank you,

John Collins-Muhammad, 21st Alderman  50:07
Mr. President. Thank you very much. I have some issues with this, with this with this amendment. I mean, so this amendment is essentially saying, and this is my problem, because of the scope of size of this board bill. We're essentially saying that the mayor is going to have the authority to say what is lawful, and what is unlawful with what we put into practice with this legislation. Now, she has already came out against us putting money in North St. Louis on major corridors. So she can easily say that this is unlawful and use the city councilor as a political tool, which we've seen done before, before, before, time and time again. With his federal money, we still have to get approval from the federal government to spend it. So we can put what everyone put into a board bill all day long. The federal government can still say, well, we're not going to do this. And this is not right. So if it is unlawful, if it is unconstitutional, the federal government will stop it. But right now, we are adding unnecessary layer today, today's legislation and giving the mayor unlimited power to determine what his money should go. And I'm just against that we are the legislative body. Our job is to allocate our job is to serve as a check and balance to the executive branch. And with this right here, we are giving our power away as a legislative body to the Board of VNA, and now completely against that, and I would encourage all of my colleagues to be against it as well. Again, if there is a problem if there is something unconstitutional, the federal government will say, and we don't need the board of VNA to act as a federal government, we already have that. I encourage all my colleagues to vote this amendment down. I do appreciate my colleague from the 24th for his due diligence, however, this amendment is unnecessary. It's messy. It's a it's another layer of protection. That just is not needed. Thank you, Mr. President, I yield back.

Marlene Davis, Alderwoman ward 19  52:17
Thank you. I'm

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  52:20
Alderman from 15. You haven't spoken for the first time.

Dr. Megan Green, 15th ward Alderwoman  52:24
Thank you, Mr. President, members of the board,  I just want to address something that I've heard now said twice today that is inaccurate. The federal government will not tell us proactively, that we cannot spend money on something, what we have to do we spend the money, and then submit verification of the expenditures. And so retroactively, the federal government could come back and tell us that we spent money on something that was not an authorized expense, which then means that if we spent money on something that is not authorized, the city is then on the hook to pay that money back. And so we have to recognize that this is a dangerous game of chicken that that potentially could be played here. If we go expending funds that we know or have a good chance are outside of these interim guidelines. And I think we also need to be clear that these are interim guidelines that they are being updated pretty continually until the final rule gets issued in August. And so up until that time, we don't know what the final rule is. And so if we expend funds on something that is not authorized, we will then be in a position of having to pay back potentially 10s of millions of dollars to the federal government, which puts the city in a in a in a financial predicament that we don't necessarily want to be at. And so I just want to make that very clear that this is not a proactive, the federal government tells us in advance of extending these funds, what we can and cannot do that they will tell us after the fact after that we've already spent this money.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  54:25
Okay, I'm alderman from the 20 seconds. You and alderman for the first came about same time. I don't know if you want to defer to her or you go first. 

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  54:41
I didn't take my hand down. 

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  54:43
Okay, call for the first

Sharon Tyus, 1st ward Alderwoman  54:47
Mr. Press, the board the Alderwoman from the 15th. That's exactly right about how things work. That's why I said for the chase Park Plaza, we had to pay the money back. I will go and dig up the Mr. Hurd came to the hoods meeting in 2013, when I came back here, and the alderman from the former alderman from the 21st, and I were on him about how the funds were spent from her. And he did. And we asked about projects that had to be repaid back. And he sent us 11. Like it was like, quick, that we had already expended the money, and then we had to pay it back.  So the Alderwoman is correct from the 15, toward the other men from the 21st doesn't understand the severability clause. It doesn't give the mayor more power. The mayor already has unfettered power, and that comes from the charter, and it's all a veto. And when she vetoes it, it takes 20 of us to overrule it if she does not believe that she also has a fiduciary duty to make sure that what we are doing our correct, we're checks and balances to one another. Let me tell you some things I did not want to say. So I'm going to say some of the things because I've tried to stay out of this. I'm American veto this and call us back into session. This is the first thing I want you to know. Okay, you can call us back into session with this, just only this and that's all we'll have to deal with. There are some other powers, I will tell you again that the mayor has, this is a good compromise here. People please put this back in here it is don't do the Boogey Man thing because it's just not true. A several bility clause just keeps everything else that we have in place in place. And except for her The only thing that would have to go to court and prove that we are not meeting some kind of lawful agenda. Okay, our lawful law that has been put in place of how this money is spent, you take the severability clause out. If they find one thing, everything goes out of the plan. And we start all over.  So for all those listings for the quarter of Natural Bridge, which, of course, when I was gerrymandered arguments, the former mayor slay stole my $500,000 that Mayor Harman had put in for the Natural Bridge quarter. And I've been working with Porter for 30 years. So of course, I'm supportive of any portion of not only Natural Bridge, Martin Luther King, not random, whatever. But you all are looking at this thing wrong, and you're shooting yourself in the foot. And you're gonna make me tell her what she can do with her powers. And the the ordinance. I mean, the severability clause is not anything which you all are trying to make it this burger bear thing. It is incorrect, what you're saying almost every last one of you, those of you who don't like how the mayor has been dealing with them. Board of Aldermen, I understand some of that concept, also have not liked the last six, five minutes how they dealt with the Board of Aldermen, and you weren't about money that gets expanded and changed. I want to tell you about the blues that sit over there in our building and don't pay any rent. But you know what the Board of Aldermen did not pass that that's not what we said they could do. We said something different, and then those alphabet suits over there changed it. And we never did a dadgum thing about it. We let the blue sit over there and not play, pay rent. And not only that we spend some more money as a landlord, that's appalling to me, I will not let anybody not pay rent and then not make them fix up their own facilities that they're using rent free. So we already have lived many, many times people change things that we have set out to do. And they change it all the time with the board of adjustments. And it's unfair, oftentimes to North St. Louis. But this severability clause is protecting those very things that you've seen to say you want. Now what you're attempting to do this, I know what some people are attempting to do, you're saying we're not gonna have a severability clause. And then so no one better not touching. It does not have to be the mayor that takes this to court. It could be anybody. You let one thing be found wrong. The whole thing is thrown out. If that's what you want, go ahead and do it. But it is a wrong thinking. It is dangerous. There's some good things that I've seen. I haven't put anything in that I wanted the things that you want that you're trying to protect. You're not going to protect it, you're going to do the opposite of what you're trying to do. And then you're going to find out if the mayor's, as far as the city council are being controlled by the mayor. That's not true. Somebody out to read the charter. The city councilor represents all of us. In fact, the first person that says the city council represents is the Board of Aldermen. Now we have some people let that go. I have always challenged that with the city councilors and if you've challenged them they will say they do not represent the mayor. The mayor appoints the city councilor, but there's a very famous Supreme Court case that tells President Clinton, his lawyers, the courts told him no those boys worked for the United States of America. It is also true for the state level and for the city level, but first is very specific. First.  Hello. Hello. Can you hear me? Okay. Our chart is very

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:00:38
we'd lost you again. Well, some people are saying they can hear me shaking. 

Shane Cohn, 25th ward Alderman  1:00:43
Mr president you were fading in and out. Okay,

Pamela Boyd, 27th ward Alderwoman  1:00:49
hear me better this weekend here. Alderwoman Tyus. Lewis is freezing up.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:00:54
I was freezing up. Okay.

Sharon Tyus, 1st ward Alderwoman  1:00:59
Our charter is very specific in saying not only does the city council represent first the Board of Aldermen, but list all the departments and things like that. So that is a miss information campaign that has been gone on for years, it's been to court, the courts have settled this. So I would tell people to get out the charter and read it, then you will know the mayor cannot direct the city councilor against us. And if she do, we can take the city councilor to court. We can also report the city councilor to the bar association, because they're following. They're following the law, as it is outlined in the charter about who they represent. Sometimes there is a conflict, and the city counselor will conflict out and hire lawyers. And that has happened to me in the past before, but the city counselor does not work for the mayor. So that whole thing about controlling the city councilor is just not true unless you got to make that a blanket thing and say that every Mayor does that. And I've seen some councils that do not follow with Mayor, our own counselor, when Francis slay was the personal board and our counselor at the board different with him on many, many occasions, and was very vocal about it. In siding with alderman who were correct. And mayor. I mean, I'm sorry, the person who had to back down. So a counselor, a lawyer is not supposed to tell you what you want to hear. They're supposed to follow the law. And the city councilor is a practice law and has a lot of we like many of us, and they're not too fond of giving up the law, but we are having bar complaints filed against them. So I wish people would not say that, again, I would implore you to support this amendment. It is a good amendment. It protects all those things that you say that you want to protect. The mayor can not just go in there and say, Oh, I don't like this under guys. We don't have a a severability clause. There's some other things she can do. But the severability clause does not give the mayor any additional powers what I want to say it protect some of the things that we've put in there. So anybody who's putting out misinformation that this somehow gives Mayor additional power is wrong. That's not what it does. It will protect if somebody Joe Blow goes to court and says, Hey, the Board of Aldermen didn't do this, right. And this is what they didn't follow. Because there are certain guidelines regarding what you could spend this money on and so much of it has to be for public safety, and they're not doing that, and then we blow up the entire bill. I do not believe that is what we want to do. I have again, I have not put my two cents in most of this, but I'm doing justice fit to say do not get caught up in the misinformation. This is a good amendment. Thank you.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:03:59
Alderwoman from the 19th. 

Marlene Davis, Alderwoman ward 19  1:04:05
Thank you, Mr. President, members of the board anyway to listen and evaluate the position of this amendment. I cannot argue with either side, I understand what's going on.  We've had a very embarrassing process take place the last month or so. It is appalling what has happened, the disrespect that has been there and the total total disrespect to the Board of Aldermen not being inclusive, not having the opportunity to appoint people to committees of importance, a number of things and so this is where people are apprehensive at this moment. And also to sit and see na embarrass the entire region. And I mean, literally the region has been paying attention to all of this, and to sit and pass. Well, this believe that a piece of legislation was passed in E&, with a process that does not even exist in order to move forward. So people are concerned, if you're not going to follow the charter, the process of procedures of legislation being moved, and appropriations done, the way that is outlined to be done, there's a lot of question and concern. And so that's the reason why the severability clause was removed. And a lot of people want to support it, because they don't feel like they have any trust. Until they see something better. They're probably going to hold their ground. But I think it's worth us talking a few more minutes to see where you want to be. But many times, we are our own worst enemy.  And I'm going to tell you, because I didn't get a return call from the mayor last week. Before all that other stuff happened, because I wanted to talk about it. I didn't get a return call from the policy director, I was trying to talk to him. Because you've got to understand, this is not a dictatorship. Our charter purposely has a weak mail system involved, which means you must rely on the Board of Aldermen in order to move things forward. And it's a real simple process, all we have to do is work together. I don't appreciate the way that we've been talking to each other in a disrespectful manner. I don't appreciate the fact that every time you want to go, Oh, woe is me. For the poor people, I'm trying to protect them. But yet you didn't include them upfront. So as you know, we have reason to be concerned. There's also a lot of what has happened in the past, and how funds were used. And the Alderwoman. From the first she did talk about a number of projects that we did have to pay the money back up. But that was because people will try to be slick, they will try to use a money that was allocated based on census tracts of eligibility and use it somewhere else. And they got caught, and they had to pay that money back. Because the chase Park Plaza did not fit in any of the eligibility requirements that was set. So we do understand that there were a number of others. So I'm hoping that at some point, the mayor's office would definitely set settle down. Let's try to work together. We do understand that there are a lot of new people there, we do understand you still have not had an opportunity to set policy for your office. So we really don't know understand anything that's on your mind. And we can't follow it if we don't know. And I really want to see that happen. But I do understand the concern that people have about the severability clause. And maybe we can get around this. I'm doubting it. But we may have to pass this without having a severability clause. And we can always come back around. Because remember, this is just a this is less than a third of the funds that must be allocated for the future. And hopefully we can come together and sit down and make sure that we are working together on behalf of the residents for this city. Because right now, we don't look good to them. And I want us to do better. So Mr. President, I'm still gonna listen. But I still have apprehension. And I'm gonna tell you honestly speaking. This is my third mayor. But you know, I've been around I've been involved all the way back to civilities. And we have really taken ourselves to a place where we should not be. And I want to have success for this for the current administration, because at the current administration is not successful, none of us are successful. So we have got to come together, and help educate, and help bring forward a lot of things that we have not had conversations about. Everybody's trying to one up each other and try to be their boss, or read the charter. Because you're not the boss of the alderman, or the President of the Board of altium. China does not allow that. So what we need to do is to work together. And I didn't need to talk that long. But I tell you, I am so full. And everybody I talked to, they're asking me what's wrong, what is wrong with us. And all I know is that we need to make sure that we are not forgotten. We need to make sure that some things are put in place early on, to see if you pay attention to everything that's, that's being talked about. So I get my pointers from Bynes administration every day they've sent to my email. Also, the guidelines that were set allows us to do the things that we put in place. So I don't want folks to, you know, come up with all these crazy things about what you can't do, because it's not true. But what we do need to do is to learn how to work together and respect each other. And with that, Mr. President, I'm done. Thank you.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:11:50

Oh, I apologize. I think we're all of us having some connection issues today. So in a recent HUDs meeting, you abstained from a vote due to being an active attorney with with a local law firm, correct?

Jack Coatar, 7th ward Alderman  1:12:51
No, guys sit here and ask me a bunch of leading questions. I'm not going to do I won't go through this process with you again, alderman. But I abstained from a bill in HUD recently goes I had a conflict. My firm was involved in the deal.

Bill Stephens, 12th ward Alderman  1:13:04
Yes, I just wanted to ask, and I appreciate you humoring me for this this one question. And I apologize for the leading question. But would you and you know, I'm asking just generally, would you ever tell a client to renew severability clause? I mean, it is an added layer of protection, isn't it legally speaking?

Jack Coatar, 7th ward Alderman  1:13:26
I mean, I'm not going to get into this line of questioning, I would give advice to clients on a case by case basis. Most of my clients are not municipalities debating, you know, legislation. And in most instances, as I stated in my comments earlier, alderman I think severability clauses are important. I think the situation we have here is the level of trust and the breakdown between the board and the new administration is such that I do believe there'll be active efforts in conjunction with room 200 to strip parts of this bill that they don't like, and I'm not going to support that. 

Bill Stephens, 12th ward Alderman  1:13:58
Excellent. Thank you. That's my only question there. But does get to my point? So what we're discussing right now with this amendment is essentially the same, say, a different side of the same coin? We're discussing protection? Correct. That's been my interpretation of it. So on the one hand, we have this amendment to re add a severability clause which allows a faulty part of the bill to be removed if necessary, without putting at stake the rest of the bill. Without it, per a an opinion from the city councilor. It would jeopardize the poor bonus entirety and put the city at severe liability. What we're, what we're discussing is either a severability clause or a dead hand strategy from the Soviet Union. I mean, you're not looking to to just protect it. As it's presented. Currently, it would put the city at an incredibly vulnerable position where not only would we have to throw out the entire bill If faulty, it will also ultimately harm the city if we had to pay back any fines that were incorrectly applied or used, that's a dead hand strategy.  And I absolutely support layers of protection. I absolutely support fail safes and, as presented currently it is the ultimate failsafe. But I, in summation, rather quickly again, with thanks to alderman from the seven for humoring me, I can support this and I hope that we can quickly and swiftly move on to the next proceeding in this this meeting. And with that, I yield back, Mr. President.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:15:39
All the alderman from the 21st. 

John Collins-Muhammad, 21st Alderman  1:15:39
Thank you, Mr. President. I yield to the Ottoman from the 22nd ward. alderman from the 22nd. Ward.

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  1:16:02
Thank you. From point first thank Miss president, the board. Mr. President, listening to all the debate on this amendment. Searching, I've expressed my trepidation about having it inserted. I do want the merit to be successful as the Alderwoman from a 19th. Ward said, if the mayor successful were all successful, and that's not the first time I've said that. But I have general concerns about how room 200 interacts with the legislative body. It hasn't been that friendly, oftentimes heavy handed, and it leaves certain people out. But I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to reverse my decision and go out on a limb and trust that the mayor is going to do the right thing. And so therefore, I'll ask my colleagues to support this amendment, that the alderman from the 24th has offered.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:17:04
Thank you. Thank you, alderman from the third.

Brandon Bosley, 3rd ward Alderman  1:17:13
Well, thank you, Mr. President. Appreciate alderman from the 22nd. And I do believe that conversation on these issues are extremely important for us because it gives us perspectives on things and it also gives us okay, what I want everybody to remember today, I hope I can be very, very well. There's a lot of interference today with the clouds and other things. But we, as a board, have not had 10 weeks to gotcha. These amendments, we haven't had even five hours to go through everything that has been presented today. So as we make decisions, those people that are watching us individually that are also involved. These are decisions that we are thinking about as immediate solutions or non solutions to the issues that we think possible issues or problems or solutions to whatever it is that helps.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:18:20
can hear can hear. Can't hear you back. Is it your signal? No, you're good? No, no, you're good. Now. You know what, let me fix this. 

Brandon Bosley, 3rd ward Alderman  1:18:32
Can you can you hear me much better now? Yes. Okay. Sorry about that. Um, what I was saying was, I know we all are trying to figure things out today. I just want folks to know that are watching and just such as aborts, remember, we all haven't had many hours and days and weeks to digest all of this information that we all have presented to each other. So these are things that we're thinking about kind of on the go right now. So there will be some discussions that take place. And it's good for us to have those discussions so we can get those different perspectives that each other has to help us come up to some amicable place to where we all feel like at least we are getting something in the real compromise. So I appreciate the audit person from 22nd. And everybody working to try to compromise within this. I will say this though. I believe severability clauses. So the very last thing that you see in any contract or board bill from my personal personally, the times that I've seen severability clauses in general, they've always come last in contracts. And I guess that's like an X alderman Ryan. Just a question. So one question I have or severability quote clauses The last thing we generally say in contracts

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:20:00
alderman from the 24th alderman from third ask you to you know for questioning. 

Bret Narayan, 24th Ward Alderman  1:20:05
Absolutely. 

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:20:07
Third, please proceed.

Brandon Bosley, 3rd ward Alderman  1:20:08
Just a quick question, alderman. And the 24th. Our severability clause is generally the last thing that we see there in contract contractual languages and languages here and our board bills. 

Bret Narayan, 24th Ward Alderman  1:20:20
Typically, yes, it's it's the the last paragraph. You know, in contracts, you can lay out the contract however you want. But I can tell you when I'm drafting contracts for clients, I basically always advise them to have a severability clause. And I would not put forward a board bill, in my capacity as an alderman that did not contain a severability clause just for fear that if if I miss something, and a court reviews it, and a court decides that any part of it is as unconstitutional or unenforceable or struck down for any reason that it doesn't undo the entire bill. So this, this doesn't allow for any sort of, you know, pick and choose. And, in fact, the the amendment itself, states that the courts must decide not that he na, or the mayor decides anything, this is just in the in the instance that that someone challenged any portion of this board bill, either as to the constitutionality of things or the the appropriate use of this fund funding, they

Brandon Bosley, 3rd ward Alderman  1:21:31
want to cut you off. I just want to be real specific. Just I know, you've been doing a lot of speaking and you've answered this question, not this specific question. But you know, you definitely answered some questions today. So I know we have a long day. I don't want to be disrespectful at all. I appreciate the answer. Just I just try to I just want to be stubborn because I can't can be. Generally the severability clause comes after all of the different things that you want in the contract, because it protects those things that could potentially, like you said, unconstitutional in the event that those are. Does that thing for me or no, no, there's just walked in the room? I'm sorry. No problem. So generally, that just protects the contract that says have anything in here is unconstitutional was deemed, you know, we can't uphold this within the contract and everything else can be substantiated. We'll keep on rolling. Right. Exactly. So with that, you generally will put those clauses at the very, very end of the contract, because if you put it before, the severability clause, it kind of would make sense for everything because the severability is for everything that comes before the clause. Correct.

Bret Narayan, 24th Ward Alderman  1:22:38
It would be for the entire either agreement or piece of legislation, the order in which you place it doesn't doesn't change the the applicability of the severability clause. 

Brandon Bosley, 3rd ward Alderman  1:22:51
Okay. Well, so I would say I guess Traditionally, the severability clause is though at the very end, correct. But 

Bret Narayan, 24th Ward Alderman  1:22:57
oftentimes,

Brandon Bosley, 3rd ward Alderman  1:22:58
 oftentimes, so I've always seen them at the end. I've never seen them in the very beginning. So with that being said, I just want to say, Hey, we got a lot of different amendments that we're gonna go through today, there's a lot of stuff we're going to talk about with the severability clause coming first. And this being something that we know protects everything else that we're going to talk about today. Is there any way we can just hold this until the end, I mean, it probably will make sense for the severability clause to become the last amendment. We don't be speaking all day about the different issues that we feel exists within our bill. Today, we're going to be talking about a lot of different amendments. And the different things that exists may or may cause people to vote a different way, as time goes on, seen as we generally as a board deal with severability clauses, very end of our board bills, especially with that even traditionally, kinda how we do things. So I'm just putting, putting it out there. Maybe it makes sense for a second. And maybe it's one of the last amendments that we deal with there today. There's a discussion we need to take. You know,

Bret Narayan, 24th Ward Alderman  1:24:15
I would disagree with you there for a couple of reasons. First, I don't think it matters which order we take these amendments, and it's about what makes it into our final piece of legislation. And ultimately, you know, we've now been discussing this for for roughly an hour or so. So I would like to bring this to a vote

Brandon Bosley, 3rd ward Alderman  1:24:36
by just putting it out there, you know, I board bills are structured in a certain way. We have whereas before, not after, you have severability clauses in the very end, not before. You know, so this just probably makes sense for us to put this at the end. Just wanted to throw that out. There we are. We do have a structure board. We've instruction ourselves a lot more since I have to call This is regarding the clerk. Also, these are different, and I appreciate the different paths we've been taken to be more structured as a board. So I just wanted to put that out that we do generally see things like this at the very end. So this man here in the beginning, when we're making decisions about everything that's going in between their clubs, it's just a little different. But I mean, I different tours, that hasn't been done before. But the way we generally have been doing things, the way our board goes, the structured side is something that needs to be pointed out. So I appreciate that. I do believe that there needs to be some type of something in there that ensures that whatever, we do damage some point in time but may not be constitutional. What it is that we do, there needs to be something that continues the rest of the processes that we have already started. So I'm definitely not in disagreements with the severability clause. I just know, there's a lot that we need to discuss today. And I just want us to make sure that we are utilizing every bit of the time that we have wisely been structured as we can so we can follow ourselves the way that we've been kind of working towards doing so. So appreciate you. Thank you. Would that. Take any more questions? Unless you have a comment you would like to make automated right? 

Bret Narayan, 24th Ward Alderman  1:26:27
No, thank you for the question. And, you know, I think that you know, this, this clause will go at the end of things. I think we're just jumping around and at the order of amendments as all, but I do appreciate the question.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:26:41
Thank you, Mr. President. What do you have a question? For just one quick question. of alderman from the 10th. Um, because due to the nature of the question, is it concerning DNA alderman from the 10th?

Brandon Bosley, 3rd ward Alderman  1:27:03
No, it's not concerning DNA. It is completely about the the the board bill here at hand, just the severability clause.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:27:12
Alderwoman from the 10th 

Joe Vollmer, 10th ward Alderman  1:27:14
Yes, sir. 

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:27:16
Would you take over his chair for a minute. 

Joe Vollmer, 10th ward Alderman  1:27:20
But I'm going to use my new one second, sir. 

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:27:25
Awesome, Mr. President, so I'm gonna preface it by saying I'm not I'm not planning on spending a lot of times DEBATING these things, but it appears this may be a quick, easy. Alright, so president of Huawei, you have a question from the alderman from the third. Oh, yes, I will.

Brandon Bosley, 3rd ward Alderman  1:27:47
Thank you. Just a quick question in your time or being as President, have you ever seen a severability clause being presented there in the very beginning of a board bill? 

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:27:55
No. 

Brandon Bosley, 3rd ward Alderman  1:27:57
Are it's true opinion that they are always at the very end of four bills?

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:28:02
I yes.

Brandon Bosley, 3rd ward Alderman  1:28:04
Thank you. That's the only question that was president. Okay.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:28:07
All right. All right. 

Joe Vollmer, 10th ward Alderman  1:28:08
Thank you very much, Mr. President. 

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:28:13
Any further, Any further discussion? Any further discussion? All woman from the 27th for the first time?

Pamela Boyd, 27th ward Alderwoman  1:28:23
Yes, I just wanted to make a comment I wanted to, uh, I've been sitting,  I haven't been here as long as the Alderwoman from the first or the Alderwoman of the 19th, or the alderman or the 22nd. But I've just every session, I get an education. And so I just want to thank you all, because as Alderman Bosley is saying, every time someone speak, we learn a little bit more, and we're educated a little bit more. And so I just want to make that comment and say that sometimes you compromise and alderman tie as you buy more than anybody should understand the hesitant of people right now from the way this administration has treated us. And so that's why I think people are hesitant to say yes, because they just feel like it's a hidden agenda. And so I'm not saying nobody's right or nobody's wrong, but I just don't feel that if nobody tries to compromise. We are never moved to the next Page. And so we are we compromised with the previous administration. We compromise with the other previous administration, as I look at the emails just come in and they're saying that is illegal. What we're trying to do from the city councilor, but this is interest me that is illegal because we're focusing on North St. Louis and as Alderwoman Tyus has said continuously meetings? No, Aye St. Louis continuously gets screwed. And they do what they want to do. And then they come back and say, now you're out that you looked at this wrong. So thank you all for the education again, because I'm learning every day. And I used to tell my dad, you never get too old to learn. So I appreciate that. But it's just to the point. And as Alderwoman Davis said, people are scared, especially the African American out of people, we are nervous, because we feel like we're not in golf, or braced by the administration to support us, and the efforts that we want to happen in our communities. And so we stand by and look at other communities that are blossoming, and our communities are still left there with the derelict buildings tore up Street, you know, and had grass. And everybody keeps saying we're wrong. So I just have a problem with that. I hate for you all to notice. But our community wants clean, quiet neighborhoods with clean yards and build instead of not falling down just like you have a want to your communities. So thank you all very much.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:31:29
Thank you. Alderwoman. From the from the first. Well, wait, am I Alderwoman. From the from the six.

Christine Ingrassia, 6th ward Alderwoman  1:31:46
Thank you, Mr. President. I just wanted to clarify quickly on the amendment, we are looking at Page 32. Right after Section A right before section 19, we would put in the severability clause right next to the emergency clause. At the very end of the board bill. Our amendments don't go necessarily in order of conversation. That's why the amendment pieces have a Page number and a line item. So just to help allay the alderman from the third's concerns that this would be at the end of the bill where they typically go, thank you

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:32:31
all one from the first

Sharon Tyus, 1st ward Alderwoman  1:32:35
thank you The spreads and members of the board. The other one from the six state address something what I was gonna say, which is that you when you're writing a contract, as an attorney, you might put the standard pieces in first before anything. So the emergency clause and the severability clause, you might start that out before you even do the contract, because you know, you've got to put those in, they then you can still put them in the order of which they will be saying the you really could put the central mobility clause and emergency clause as the first two paragraphs, it wouldn't change anything. It's just a way we've done it. But it does not change anything. I'm addressing this issue now does not change anything, it would still be at the end. Because the last two things often are the emergency clause and the severability clause, but they could be the first two things. Okay. It wouldn't change anything. The Alderwoman from the 27 talked about being unsure and feeling left out. There is no body at this board alderman that has stood up for this current administration as much as me. So remember that, okay, nobody been with our longer than all of you all, even the ones who think that they were there. So, and I have been very quiet, expressed what I thought about what's going on to the Black Caucus, which I joined again. So you all know what I said. Um, so I don't want to get into my disappointment because my disappointment also were with the last 20 years of white mayors who took a ward and to limit the President took my ward out of North St. Louis, cause North St. Louis 15 to $20 million. So the things that how our Ward looks now has nothing to do with this current mayor. Okay, I don't believe in Boogey Man politics. Okay. If I thought it in a way that this was going to be giving the mayor a chance to do something that was not right for North St. Louis. I would be leading the fights. I think you know, that Alderwoman from the 27th floor. Okay, I would be  This is a simple severability clause that protects all the things that you all have put in there, which I think are good things. But I will say this before we even started to address this issue. I won't say the person who called me but you know, they've been putting they put Together be this money a long time ago. And they had people sitting on committees. And one of the people said on the committee before this committee that the mayor before she was even the mayor, so set on statewide and national committees, they called and talked to me at length about the safeguards that they were putting in this bill. And one of them was about, they put a lot of emphasis on public safety. So if we get out of our lane, I'm sorry, on the one from the 19th, I'm borrowing that for you from you. Because that is a good term for me. In this case, if we get out our lane, we will get in trouble. And we will have to pay things back. And if the city council is saying certain things that we put in here in the bill, or illegal, it could be because we're not fitting within the parameters, because they have percentages. And one of the things that acts at the caucus meeting which the ultimate from the 22nd sent me some some of the parameters were what were the parameters for spending, because when we hear this great amount of money, we go off and running, okay, we got to resolve certain issues. But what you will often find is that people who wrote parameters before we got ahold of this, have put parameters that didn't let us do everything that we thought we could do. And if we put those in the bill anyway, and then either someone takes it to court, or if someone in someone takes to court, then we're in trouble.  I want us to protect all the good work. I do not want us to let that go away all of the work that you all done, which I have not been part of this. I'm all supportive of it. I don't have anything in this bill, I will get the things that I need. But I didn't have anything personally in this bill, except for I absolutely agree that Martin Luther King should be fixed and the quarter. Absolutely real Natural Bridge North ran with florists and whatever. I grew with those things. And then some, but let's not think let's not speak up the ills of North St. Louis without saying who did that this was not this current mayor. That was the previous two mayors, one that served 16 years four terms and did the most harm to North St. Louis along with the president than I ever remember. So let's let's get off of that. What we're talking about is is this a good thing to have in our bill? It absolutely is it does not make any difference about what order it is put in, it is going to protect you. I would not tell you that. If it was not I'd be leading the pack said Don't you dare do that. It does. Somebody is doing Boogeyman politics. And I do understand why people don't feel comfortable. And I will say this publicly for the first time now. So I was uncomfortable. But there was a committee put together that there was not one black single alderman. Okay. I was uncomfortable with that. And I called the mayor's office the next day and said, What is going on here? It didn't have to be me. But I was not happy with that. So let me just say that and there are other things. And I would say that about any Mayor that did that. If you leave out the black alderman then you cannot have a white alderman make decisions for North St. Louis does not represent us and the person who I'm talking about I said it to their face, okay. You do not represent North St. Louis, you do not live here. You do not get to make decisions for my community. This is a joint collaborative effort saying all of that, we still need the severability clause. Okay.  And so that is why I am saying that I am not saying that you got a trust or whatever. But any of you who know me know that if that's all it was one iota that was a gift nor St. Louis. You didn't have to be saying I would be saying that this is not against North St. Louis. And it doesn't help the mayor do anything because the city council can send us opinions all he wants to about is this legal or not. Unless he actually goes and files a lawsuit, which he doesn't do because if I'm the mayor if I think that it's something illegal, I'm gonna veto this bill. If I think that you have illegal things and it cannot be addressed in a way that we'll be able to take the things as illegal. I'll just be told the bill. See I got my big girl pants on and I told the last Mayor to do that about the firefighters thing and that did get vetoed so I am big girl pants everyone you've been in for 30 years. You can do you can say what you want to say pretty much Okay, so there is no big bag boober or mirrors Don't do this. That's what she got that pin install a veto for and you all do not have enough to override the veto. So please protect the things that you have done. Please do not get into this thing of just a one upmanship. I'm asking you, Mr. President, because who I've called will not return my phone call all these times trying to put an end to some of this thing. I thought I could help but you have not returned my call or call all your staff. You will not return my call. I've talked to your staff and told them what I wanted to speak to stop this one upsmanship This is a simple thing that protects all the work that has gone into it. And anybody who thinks that I would be supporting this if I in any way legally, or emotionally or any other kind of way that it was against North St. Louis has not served with me, because that is not with anything I would do. So I'm going to join with alderman 22nd war to say, please support this. And let's move on to something that maybe we really could differ on. This should not be anything that should even be a difference. This should be in there for protection of all the good work you've done. Thank you.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:40:38
Any further discussion in further discussion? alderman from the 21st.

John Collins-Muhammad, 21st Alderman  1:40:50
Thank you, Mr. President. Well, we've been at this for a little over an hour now. I'm really tempted to just call the question, but I won't do that. But I know that in this legislation in this board bill, we have fit all the parameters outlined by the US Department of Treasury, under the vine administration. Put in a severability clause in that will allow in a to take out certain portions of this legislation. And I'm currently looking at more Bill 239. That was introduced on the 15th of May of 2021. And that was the COVID relief funds under the previous administration. And there is no severability clause in that legislation. There is an emergency clause, but there is no severability clause in that exact language that is being that is being offered by my colleague from the 24th. It Again, we are following the parameters are the US Department of Treasury. That's what that's what we're doing right now. I haven't anessa add, Mr. President. I just think we are racing a little bit of time on this. I think we have numerous other members to go through. I want this to be constructive and productive meeting like everyone else. I do agree. I do agree with the automa from the first Ward, as she was talking about the special advisory board the mayor appointed, there was no black voice for North St. Louis, on that. on that board, and I know she says she shouldn't be the one that was picked. I disagree. To represent 60 115 there was a zip code that was most affected by COVID-19, the zip code that had the most cases of positive Coronavirus testing it me and her and when a lot of them also searched surely a zip code. She should have been appointed to look because we had no representative on that body. And if we did a lot of what we're discussing probably would not be an issue today as of right now. But I do want to stress that issue. Mr. President, the Board of Aldermen is following the protocol and the procedure set forth by the US Department of Treasury. And I'm just a little perplexed at my colleagues for thinking that we are not doing such. I don't think this is about having faith in the mayor. I think that we all do. And we all should. I think at this point, it's about having faith in our body as the as the deliberative body for the city of St. Louis. With that, Mr. President, I yield back. I have nothing else to add.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:43:49

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:49:39

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  1:49:55
Thank you, Mr. President, members, the board for amendment number two, basically funds the criminal justice Coordinating Council. It makes them whole, give them opportunity to operate. They've been doing a lot of good work over the past year and a half. And somehow it didn't make it in the budget. But this is a way to kind of correct. You know, what didn't happen that should have happened. But I know I've been keeping track with the good work that's gone over there. And when we get this boy bill a couple of years ago, we were committed to making sure that we fund that office in a collaboration with other entities that they work with.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:50:36
All right, any further discussion in further discussion on number two? alderman from the 25th.

Shane Cohn, 25th ward Alderman  1:50:53
I had my hand up before the amendment was being discussed, Mr. President. Thanks.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:50:59
But we'll move on all in from 22nd. Second, but on the amendment number two on favor signify by saying aye. VOTE BEING TAKEN Aye. Aye. Aye. Pose.

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  1:51:12
Okay. Another moment that I have is amendment number 10. And amendment number 10, basically came about based on a memo that we received from the city council's office, and it looks like maybe our wording may be off on how we classify these these zones. And so what it's asking to do is change the wording on Page six, line 12, from business development, to economic empowerment. We don't necessarily have to put all the meat and potatoes in the ordinance. So I'm hoping that this satisfies some of the concerns that the mayor's office had, and that it fits within the narrative of the funds. And it is my hope that a policy is created within slbc that makes sure that we are spending the money in the way we're supposed to spend money. We don't have to define and get down to the nitty gritty in the actual board bill itself. But it's incumbent upon sldc to ensure that we're spending the money in the way that we can get reimbursed. So that was a part purpose of changing the language.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:52:42
Would you like to make a motion?

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  1:52:44
Yes, I like to move for adoption of amendment number chant to board bill to committee substitute as amended. Mr. President,

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:52:54
from 22nd seconded by alderman 19. discussion. All in favor signify by saying VOTE BEING TAKEN aye.

1:53:07
Aye. 

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  1:53:10
Mr. President, I yield the floor back. For other colleagues that have amendments, 

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:53:16
right, all men from the 21st. 

John Collins-Muhammad, 21st Alderman  1:53:21
Thank you, Mr. President, a move to put before us amendment number 11 to borbone number two committee substantive

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:53:37
move by alderman from the tagging and seconded by the thing alderman from the third element. Who said we'll call it alderman from the third. It's been moved and seconded all in from 21st. Please proceed.

John Collins-Muhammad, 21st Alderman  1:54:00
Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Alderman Bosley. amendment number two re reinstalls. The targeted cash assistance for St. Louis ends with this COVID with this COVID post relief funding $5 million. So residents can apply for up to $500 in cash assistance. This will be operated and administered by the Department of Human Services. Residents will have the opportunity to apply. It cleans up some of the language that was proposed and the mayor's proposal with duty stemmons advisory board is pretty simple. Everyone should have that amendment in our Google Drive. I'm looking at it now. But again, it reinstalls and refunds that $5 million for targeted cash assistance. With that, Mr. President I can take any questions if committee members habit. I yield back.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:55:06
Any further discussion on amendment number 11? 

Christine Ingrassia, 6th ward Alderwoman  1:55:10

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:55:59
If you refresh the drive, I just refreshed mine is in there. Okay. So it wasn't in there earlier. It was, um, I had it. But I got an note from one of the other alderman that some people may need to refresh depending on what time you logged in.

Sharon Tyus, 1st ward Alderwoman  1:56:22
Okay, let me try to get it now. Thank you 

John Collins-Muhammad, 21st Alderman  1:56:28

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:56:41
All the all of all the one from the 20th.

Cara Spencer, Alderwoman ward 20  1:56:47
Thank you, Mr. President. I had a couple of questions. And perhaps the alderman from the 21st would yield

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:56:53
almost from 21st. We yield the question until all the one from the 20. 

John Collins-Muhammad, 21st Alderman  1:56:57
Yes.

Cara Spencer, Alderwoman ward 20  1:56:58
Thank you all around. And I'll apologize in the front. And I know, these are I'm dragging these questions at you because you're offering the amendment. But perhaps they're not necessarily your responsibility for having the answers. But I'm hopeful that you can provide some information for us. I want to preface this by saying that I did ask these questions at the administration disappointed that I haven't gotten any response yet. Because I think it's important to understand exactly what we're planning to do here. And that we've planned accordingly to be able to accomplish that. The funds here the $5 million is based on $500 payments to individuals who fit a criteria. The the amount is to fund 10,000 people. Is that correct? Yes. Okay, and is there any? Was there any administrative cost associated with this expenditure and the distribution of funds? No, are we going to be able to just do this for free, then is are the banking institutions and the distribution channels without cost to the city?

John Collins-Muhammad, 21st Alderman  1:58:06
Well, it will be handled through the Department of Human Services, if there is any ongoing costs, the department human services are already budgeted to, to to handle this, this particular program to sign up to St. Louis. Do

Cara Spencer, Alderwoman ward 20  1:58:21
you know how the payments will be given to residents? alderman? Is it through a cheque or through a check card? It's my understanding it was a checking card. Are you asking for the application process? The distribution process? So if I am about 500? If a $500 sum, am I going to be getting a check? Or am I going to be getting a check card? Am I going to be getting a cashier's check? Is it going to be just a $500.05 $100 bills? Do you know what the system for delivering those funds will

John Collins-Muhammad, 21st Alderman  1:58:55
be? So it'd be doing debit card or a direct deposit. It's laid out in the amendment due to abort bill. I'm tempted to say you're out of order because you don't have sight watching.

Cara Spencer, Alderwoman ward 20  1:59:10
sighs outside playing chess right now. So he's not participating? He's Yes, he's listening, always lurking. But those check cards presumably will have a cost associated with them. I'm assuming a banking institution will have some level of overhead for providing 10,000 bank cards. Am I right?

John Collins-Muhammad, 21st Alderman  1:59:35
Yes, costs cost as costs are covered in the amendment. There will be a fee associated with it. And I take and I'm going to be completely transparent Alderwoman One of the things that I did not like about the initial proposal was I didn't think that it was I think it was worth the money spent right. So we are we are given 10,000 people to our city so a city with over 200 and 1000 residents only 10,000 St. Louis isn't going to benefit from this. So the reason why it's been instead of the treasurer's office and then goes to the party human services because department Human Services has the resources and already has the data and information to determine which residents needed the most. And that's why in this amendment, it lays out a different process for approval for residents to get approved, right? Because under the previous proposal, any any kid with any any any kid that's 19 or older, with a computer could apply and get the funding. That doesn't mean that the single mother and marine Villa or the father working three jobs in O'Fallon will get this funding. So with this application process this amendment it clarify the clarify, it clarifies that right, there is a cost associated with it, the cost is in the amendment. Will it be? Will it be a? Will it be worth it? Will this amendment be worth it? Right? Honestly, we don't know. We have no clue. Is it going to change things overnight? For our city, our neighborhoods? Absolutely not. But it will help struggling families who needed the most in our communities. So there will be a cost associated with it, whether it's direct deposit, or of course, whether it's a debit card, but it still gets the money in the pockets of the families and the residents that needed the most.

Cara Spencer, Alderwoman ward 20  2:01:28
I so I'm looking at the amendment. And I apologize, alderman I don't see the overhead costs associated with distributing these funds. And let me be let me let me preface this and say I you know, I mean, we were planning on going to exhibit I don't mean to be praying too much. And alderman I don't believe it's your responsibility or any of our response really, really to develop these plans or proposals or the processes or processes. I mean with that is beyond really what our capacity here at the Board of Aldermen really is. So my line of questioning is really just to understand how planned out this is. I mean, this is not a small amount of money. This is $5 million. And, you know, the question, or the point you made earlier about 10,000 people was a question that I had for the administration, how was the 10,000 people determined or estimated we have a city of close to 300,000, as you pointed out, 280,000 22% are estimated to live at or below poverty, which would put us at about 60 65,000 people that could theoretically be eligible for these funds. And if we aren't plan being well, for how we're going to accommodate all of those who would qualify, we're going to have some major problems on our hands, it's going to be an equitable, those who know about it, first, we'll be able to obtain it first. If we don't have a fully fleshed out plan for how we would expand the program should we need it if there are more people who qualify, those who need it most, those most vulnerable residents who often do not have access to information would be those who would absolutely not be on the front end of this. And I have some very grave concerns about that, considering and mirroring how we did public outreach on this, you know, a lot of that has to do with social media, and those who are reached through traditional channels. And so my question, really, my second question was about the 10,000 people, what was used to calculate the amount needed for it the 10,000 individuals, and we feel confident that we're going to fully cover all of those residents within the city of St. Louis, who would qualify and Bennett could benefit from those and that we have a plan to inform those who are most vulnerable among us to get in on that first wave, alderman and I don't know if you have the answers to that, but I would welcome those answers. I have been seeking them, not because I'm opposed to this concept. But because I think most importantly, that we have to plan well, when we're doing something as important as distributing some as large as $5 million to the most vulnerable residents among our city. Thank you. I'm sorry, go ahead. I don't know if you had an answer to that 10,000 people and what that would look like but I really do have concerns about that. You know, I I also was inquiring about the method with which the city is going to determine whether or not somebody actually lives in the city. It is required that in order to receive these funds, you would have to have been a resident for 12 months. But I to this day to this moment, I have no idea the qualifications, what would prove or disprove someone's residency here. And if we're going to be distributing these funds, we should be doing it quickly while the pandemic is still among us. And we should be doing it in a way that is very clearly articulated. And we should have a plan in place to be able to do that. This is not new money. We've been we've known about this and these plans for several months now. And so a simple plan I don't think is unreasonable, but has certainly not been displayed to me. And if there are other alderman here on the board colleagues that are familiar with those details, perhaps that could be shared. But really, that also points to a real problem in the process that we've seen for the planning of the entire expenditures of these times to this point, alderman, I'll let you go ahead and try to answer what you can. And then, you know, if anybody else on the board has any insight into these questions, I think it would be important for us to to get into them. And with that, I'll yield to the alderman for the 21st to answer when he can.

John Collins-Muhammad, 21st Alderman  2:05:39
Thank you, Alderwoman. And I will answer each question in the order that it was received. Tried to jot down your question, so I may miss one. If I do, please correct me. And please make sure that I give you the answer that you're seeking. So if you look at the board, if you look at the amendment, amendment, amendment number 11, exhibit 177 percent will be given to the department human services for an administrative cost. And a reason why 7% is the department Human Services already has already has the adequate resources to determine how to administer these funds, right, in a way that we're trying to make sure that people in the city of St. Louis get the funds who need the most is, is through this application process. So a resident, of course has to prove their residency, they have to prove their income, they have to prove a variety of different things, right. And it's only it's only one cash assistance per household. So five people in one household are not going to be able to get you know, this direct deposit are not going to be able to get this debit card with the funding. We definitely tried to make a little bit more intimate to where it canceled out. People who who didn't need it, and give it to the people who need it the most. That was one question. The second question was about the planning process. I agree with you. And that's why I'm only present on this when it came to the house committee because there was no plan or process given it was just let's give it away. So with this amendment in lays out a different process and plant aliens are different protocol is real. And I agree with you, it's not the job for the Board of Aldermen to to develop a plan or process. That's the job of the executive branch. And And I'm confident that the mayor will work with the department human service and our staff to develop a comprehensive plan to to to, to monitor and administer these funds. The second question was, was about how it was about how you're speaking kind of fast, I'm trying to jot it down, and I cannot even read my own handwriting. So bear with me. Mm hmm. It gives, it definitely gives. It gives information about the census track. So so to determine who needs it the most, as well in the event? That was all your questions. I'm not sure

Cara Spencer, Alderwoman ward 20  2:08:15
it was. So I would offer to you that if there's a 7% of cost associated with this, then we need to reduce that 10,000 number to accommodate that. 7%. Right. So we would, or we would have to add to the 5 million to accommodate the total package costs, if there's an administrative fee. And then, you know, if we're going to be working with banking institutions, I assume we would do an RFP to make sure that there's a fair process here. But then, the other question, you might I guess the question would be, I would want to understand, you know, do we feel confident that the 10,000 represents all those and then again, that process for determining what, you know, who how do we how do we figure out who lives there? You know, I think it's important that we think about how we can support the most vulnerable residents among us. And, you know, I think the first step in doing that is just really making sure that we're really, you know, doing that in the most fair, snackable way possible. So, again, I just wanted to kind of get to the crux of my questions here and how just important that the planning pieces to make sure that we can do that. And I just I haven't seen that really play out well, with this particular proposal of the cash payments, not to the detriment of you or the Board of Aldermen. But I just think that we need to be much more clearly thinking through these issues, because they're so important.

John Collins-Muhammad, 21st Alderman  2:09:40
Thank Thank you Alderwoman. Thank you very much. 

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  2:09:43
Alderwoman from the 14th.

Carol Howard, 14th ward Alderwoman  2:09:48
Yes, I have similar concerns as the Alderwoman from the 20th.  I feel as though the city may not have the resources to properly vet the people that may be applying for the We have a very mobile population in the city of St. Louis. And I, my concern is that maybe this money would be better spent to incentivize getting vaccinations. We have a very low vaccination rate in the city of St. Louis. You know, we are in the throes, you know, of maybe a new pandemic a new rise in people getting the new strain of the Coronavirus. I don't know that $500 is going to make or break anyone. I mean, we have money set aside for groceries housing, I just think that we need to be more strategic and how this money would be distributed and handled. My concern is that, you know, that it's a considerable amount of money, this whole package could be transformational for the city of St. Louis, North Side, South Side all around. Is this something that is going to be fair and equitable? Or is this money that you know, people may apply for and as the alderman from the 20th mentioned, those that are most vulnerable and most deserving, probably don't have access to computers to apply for this.  I know that putting it over in the the Department of Human Services is probably a better fit. But again, we have a very mobile population. So are these going to be sent and and maybe, you know, not received, or there's just so many unknowns about this. And I don't think we need to get in the weeds about this. But I think we need to be assured that how this is administered is solid and equitable and reaches those people that need it. My other concern is, you know, the 10,000 people, what about the other people that are vulnerable that are going to be left off on this? I have a lot of concerns about just the cash payments, if we could tie them to some incentivize, I don't know, are even use them for housing. There's a whole lot of other things that I think we could probably use this money and piggyback onto something else. But um, it's no intention, I understand the intent is good, put some money in people's hands to maybe have a little fun. But I don't know that it's well orchestrated. That's my concern. Thank you. That's all I have to say.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  2:12:46
All one from the eighth. If I may, Mr. President, alderman said she didn't ask you to yield. But I'll call on you in a minute. If you can just keep notes on the things you want to say. 

John Collins-Muhammad, 21st Alderman  2:12:58
Yes, sir. 

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  2:12:59
Alderwoman from the 8th

Annie Rice, 8th ward Alderwoman  2:13:01
Thank you, Mr. President, members of the board. I usually do have questions for the alderman from the 21st. If you would yield

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  2:13:07
21st when you yield to all of them for me? 

John Collins-Muhammad, 21st Alderman  2:13:10
Absolutely not. I'm kidding. Of course.

Annie Rice, 8th ward Alderwoman  2:13:14
I think it Thank you, alderman. And so I I'm looking through the differences here between your proposal and the proposal that was put forward by the mayor's office. And one of the things that jumps out, can you can you tell me what your discussions were like with human services on their capacity to handle this program.

John Collins-Muhammad, 21st Alderman  2:13:37
I didn't have any discussion with the Director of Human Services. We have talked informally, about different things as relate to the COVID pandemic. I'm proud to say that she is a resident of the 21st Ward, but we have not talked in detail about this particular amendment. But with that, also want to say I don't want us to get into the the ongoing habit of seeking some type of informal approval from directors, that's not our job. Our job is to legislate Our job is to create laws. And our job is to monitor and somewhat direct, direct the affairs and operations of their departments from a legislative perspective, so there was no direct meeting or coming to the miles between me and the director, Human Services about this, but as a directly human service, I think that is missing and she is all for, again, this, this amendment lays out a more detailed plan, eligibility process, and it also allocates that that that 7% to her office to administer this to make sure that it is transparent to make sure that it is equitable, and to make sure that it is a can do so to the needs of the city of the city of St. Louis. Right. So any any amendment, we talked about the town application process, we talked about the eligibility eligibility requirements in real quick not to not to fade away from what you said about I do want to address my colleague from the 14th. Or I don't know how we're moving. So we want to make sure this gets out to people as quickly as possible in the timeline was laid out in any amendment as well. Hopefully, looking at around six, we live in around six to eight weeks to where residents can actually get this in their bank accounts or get these debit cards or get or get this direct deposit. So it it really does help them out in the midst of this COVID pandemic, we can't help everyone. I wish we could. Because I mean, I know I have 11,000 residents in my ward who needs this $500 cash assistance. I don't think that is going to change their life overnight. But I definitely think that they can help ease some of the burden that they're going to, as relates to this financial crisis that we are in, in a financial crisis that, you know, many residents in our city has been in before COVID-19. This is just a it's like a it's a courtesy is saying we hear you we see you. And we want to try to make it better. But it's all I want to say Alderwoman. Howard, back to you Alderwoman. Rice, no, no conversation has took place formerly between me and the director Human Services.

Christine Ingrassia, 6th ward Alderwoman  2:16:33
Okay. And could you just I'm I get the the proposal that we received from the mayor's office of puts this money through the treasurer's office that has the Office of Financial Empowerment that has connections with banks that already exists that has, you know, youth jobs and debit cards and direct deposit relationships already set up.

Annie Rice, 8th ward Alderwoman  2:16:55
is I'm just curious if you could talk to me about your your preference for human services to do this, instead of the treasurer's office.

John Collins-Muhammad, 21st Alderman  2:17:04
I think it makes sense Alderwoman the front of Human Services is responsible for for serving our community, as it relates to direct services from the city of St. Louis. And the relationship that the treasurer's office has. I mean, it's not a relation between the treasurer in in those bands in relation between the city of St. Louis in those banks. So that relationship is still there. The treasurer, the Marin staff, what whoever she chooses, they still have four prerogative to coordinate with the department human services to make sure that this is a smooth transition and to make sure this is this is a smooth program to roll out.

Annie Rice, 8th ward Alderwoman  2:17:42
Okay, so, um, one of the other things that I that I guess, I'm trying to figure out here, what the the mayor's proposal came to us as an amendment to the bill that would merely allocate the money, or,

Christine Ingrassia, 6th ward Alderwoman  2:17:57
yeah, allocate the money for the purposes of this type of program, the program requirements itself, were not laid out in the text of our bill to like a lot of our other allocations, because those things may need to be tweaked. So just just a statement of concern that having this within the text of the bill might make it more complicated for us to be flexible, if these requirements are deemed that we need to change them or if they're, you know, that something comes up here. The other piece that is concerning to me is there's there's a special circumstance in both your recommendation and in the mayor's recommendations, section five for undocumented St. Louis and, and your proposal deleted, the deleted they're part of the process that would allocate the money to undocumented residents and through a 501 c three partner. So that folks are their confidentiality is protected. And I'm wondering if you could talk to me about why you removed that from the process.

John Collins-Muhammad, 21st Alderman  2:18:58
Well, Indian got mentioned on Microsoft, any amendment on my Rice. Special Circumstances, we talked about undocumented cyclones, and it says that they are still eligible to receive this targeting cash assistance, so so they are still able to receive it.

Christine Ingrassia, 6th ward Alderwoman  2:19:18
Sure, but the distribution process changes in your proposal versus what the mayor's proposal was in a way that we have organizations that have been trying to distribute fundraised money to undocumented residents who are not eligible for federal aid or otherwise. And they've been able to use this 501 c three process and being able to maintain the confidentiality of the residents without having to produce social security numbers or anything like that in any government format that would potentially endanger their status in the US. So that is why that that piece of the mayor's proposal is so important is the creation of that that sort of secondary Id for folks that may not have other types of ID, and because they are, in fact undocumented. So I just it, it seems like maybe a purposeful deletion. So I just wanted to wanted to give you a chance to respond to that.

John Collins-Muhammad, 21st Alderman  2:20:14
I guess I don't understand your question Alderwoman Rice, on document undocumented undocumented residents are still able to receive the direct targeted cash assistance, different processes laid out, but they're still able to receive it under this amendment. So I don't know how to answer your question, because

Annie Rice, 8th ward Alderwoman  2:20:35
then maybe it's just better for you that I think your proposal is lacking protections for undocumented worker or for undocumented residents. I think that's, that is a gap.

John Collins-Muhammad, 21st Alderman  2:20:45
That's, I guess. Okay, that's fine. And that's fair. But the mayor's proposal also lacked a process to distribute the funds. So we laid out a more direct and detailed proposal. And you're talking about undocumented residents? Well, I want to talk about the document of residents that I do have in a 21st. Well, who needs cash assistance, who do live in the city of St. Louis, who needs it? So I understand that we have circumstances and special circumstances that relate to our undocumented population. But they're also included in this legislation. They wasn't left off to the side, we didn't say, forget about you, we made sure we put them in, especially guidelines are put into place, and they're still able to receive the cash assistance.

Christine Ingrassia, 6th ward Alderwoman  2:21:32
Sure, I guess. And as someone who has worked in this field, I'm telling you that it is more difficult under your proposal for an undocumented resident to receive these funds in a way that is safe for them. So they, it looks to me like section six, the disbursement plan in your proposal and the mayor's proposal are nearly identical, except for the allowance under your proposal for direct deposit options. And so I would say, you know, the mayor's proposal did have a disbursement plan, as a part of it, yours just has an extra direct deposit. And that may be that may be helpful. But we also may be dealing, you know, within a significantly unbanked population, and that is where the treasurer's office and the Office of Financial Empowerment specialize. So I thank you for yielding to questions, alderman from the 21st. And so my colleagues, I get my my concern here I am all for cash assistance. I think this is incredibly important and very wonderful use of the money that we have, hopefully, this is a first step towards, you know, even more significant supports for people who need it, they we have a number of programs that will address the needs of our residents in rental assistance and mortgage assistance in there are you know, we've got Well, I will say that the the state of Missouri, pulled back unemployment benefits early, has restricted childcare funding to child care facilities, we have residents who were making, you know, under $15 an hour whose wages were cut, or who don't have benefits Otherwise, there are a lot of needs that folks have that don't necessarily fit into the programs that we currently have existing. And what we're doing with cash assistance, is giving them the opportunity to make the decision for themselves and their families about what is most important to them. So when you're when you're moving month to month, when you're exempt, when you're exhausting your paycheck every month, use, you know, what is best for you, you know what Bill needs to be paid next. Um, so even with utility assistance, even with rental assistance, those problems, those programs are even harder to access. And so what we're what we're asking under cash assistance in general is that we trust folks who need the money to, to use the money the way that their family needs best for them. So I would encourage my colleagues to consider there's there's another amendment in the drive that deals with cash assistance, and they would keep it in the mayor's office or keep it in the treasurer's office, excuse me. And I would encourage my colleagues to take a look at that. And that's the plan that the mayor's office previously sent over. I think, with the relationships that the treasurer's office has, that is the best place to keep this money. I think that DHS is not set up for a direct dispersal and management of a program like this.

Annie Rice, 8th ward Alderwoman  2:24:28
And there are I am also concerned with putting the specific plan into for bill to as is in this amendment number 11 in a way that I believe it's amendment number 12 in your drive, that would keep the money in the treasurer's office. The plan itself is outside of the bill so that we have some flexibility to make those necessary tweaks if we need to. So thank you so much master.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  2:24:58
All the one for the 19th

Marlene Davis, Alderwoman ward 19  2:25:03
Thank you, Mr. President, members of the board. I'm sure there was some good intentions when this will start up. But you have many problems here, what is required for a person to make themselves eligible for something, and they're already in Danny, they're already distressed, it becomes almost impossible for them to complete the task. If any of you have ever worked for division of family services, and you were responsible for the eligibility process for someone, for a of assistance on any level, and on food stamps, you would understand what I'm talking about. The persons who are required to make themselves eligible, normally don't have the documents readily available to do that. They don't always have all the information when they appear, they get frustrated when they have to continue to go back and forth. And we definitely do not have the ones who really need it. Having the ability to deal with this application process. Online. When you talk about, it should be administered by the treasurer's office, there is no experience in the treasurer's office to provide these kinds of services. And most especially not for 10,000. People, the only thing that is available in the treasurer's office is the opportunity to partner with whomever is in charge of the actual processing of the eligibility, to match that process with the bank relationships that they had. So that to me would be where the treasurer's office would work. In partnership, whether it is the Department of Human Services, which I do not believe has the capacity to handle this on this large scale. Our other entities who do this every day, and have large staffs that can handle this, and also have the experience of working with people who come to them with the mindset with the desperate need, and all the understandings of what is required, and usually has portals to even help the people get what they need to provide themselves the eligibility requirements. So there's a lot that needs to be considered in this. And I'm hoping that at some point, we can work towards the appropriate alignment of this service. Again, I never believed in the 250 to $500. Because again, it is not going to reach people that really need to have it. We have been asked on the federal level not to use this money in this format. As you have seen, most cities have declared a public health crises by combining the issues of pandemic and crime, and making sure that people are receiving vaccinations that they're improving their ability to protect people, that they're providing additional funds for police departments, social workers and everything else, we're going to work with police, this is not the best expenditure of these funds, it is not enough money to really handle anybody on the level of what is required. We do have other additional funds that are coming in a more meaningful way to help families when you say you can only disperse to a household address only one entity. That's not how we do it. We have people who are homeless who sleep on couches, we have two or three families within one address. And each one of them need to be dealt with individually. So we have not thought this through. There is much that needs to be done in order to provide the services if you intend to really help anybody up, prove their eligibility and receive the funds. Thank you, Mr. President.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  2:29:34
Thank you. All the woman is the all the woman from the album from the first and then all of them from 27.

Sharon Tyus, 1st ward Alderwoman  2:29:49
Thank you, Mr. President and members of the board. The alderman from the 19th is kind of expressed some of my thoughts about the paynet iX gnuplot. The part that she expressed was that  When I saw this petition, this particular amendment and I saw the mayor's proposal, I thought, wouldn't it be great if these two entities could work together? I want to thank the alderman from the 21st. Ward for proposing this. There are some good suggestions in this, this more specific than other than the mayor's. But I do agree with the album from the 19th. Department of Human Services might be able to do some of it, but we need a financial component. I wish that we could have those two entities work together to come up with something. I agree $500. It's not a lot to some people, but it is to a lot of other people. I kind of disagree with Alderwoman from 14 $5 million, It's not a lot of money when we look at it. And I wish it was $10 million. And I wish we were putting an ongoing plan to help more people. If the Mr. President, members of the board, if the ultimate from the 21st floor will yield

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  2:31:00
on them from the 21st will yield the question until all the ones in first. All one from the first please proceed.

Sharon Tyus, 1st ward Alderwoman  2:31:08
I'm alderman. So what kind of timeline? And I maybe I missed this what kind of timeline Do you anticipate happening? Because if we if we do send this money over to the Department of Health, I'm sorry, Department of welfare. And so and and you haven't spoken to them? How who is going to get this program up and running? How do you see that happening? And what timeframe?

John Collins-Muhammad, 21st Alderman  2:31:38
Thank you Alderwoman Tyus, there will be an executive branch function. I don't know we don't control the operations of the executive branch as relates to the administering of programs such as this. There will be between a mayor the Director of Human Services and hopefully the Board of Aldermen will play a role duty committee of health and human services are those special committee at the President may appoint to administer these funds. But hopefully as soon as possible.  Like the alderman for the 14th day of mentioned, our we're going to get this to people right now when the need is high, hopefully so but that will be up to the executive branch. All we can do is pass legislation to aid them. It'd be up to them, but in the wants to once the once the program is rolled out and once it is accepting applications. In a disbursement plan, it says hopefully know when is it suppose plan is listed in lists different categories to to how we want to get this money into into people using different sites in different methods from the debit card and the direct deposit.

Sharon Tyus, 1st ward Alderwoman  2:32:48
When I asked the time, I don't mean to use anticipate a month, two months, three months? Do you just have anything in your own head? Since you are the author of this amendment? What will be to you as soon as possible? What would What is your thought process? And also my question is why? Why did we speak to the Department of welfare to see if this was something that they were actually set up to do?

John Collins-Muhammad, 21st Alderman  2:33:16
Thank you all. Okay, thank you Alderwoman. So I wish I had the time to do it just ahead of time. I've been doing independent research, since this came up in HUDZ, roughly just two weeks ago, doing independent research or going to other cities who have adopted this model who have done something similar nscs outlook that they are used. agency similar to our Department of Human Services, no disrespect to the treasurer's office, but the treasurer is in charge of parking and in bonds, right? The Treasurer is not in charge of delivering direct social services to residents. That's why I thought it was more befitting to send it to the Department of Human Services, which the mayor still directs as our city's chief executive. Now for us the timeline, you know, right now in the month of July, hopefully we're rolling this out right around September, hopefully in October, so residents can can access this, you know, this pool of funding.

Sharon Tyus, 1st ward Alderwoman  2:34:22
Okay, and to your point about the treasurer, the treasurer and the controller, our finance department. So they would you have an opposite any kind of opposition if the treasurer worked with the Department of welfare to try to put something together because I think that they both bring something an expertise to this. That would help one another if they were working together instead of separate?

John Collins-Muhammad, 21st Alderman  2:34:45
No, absolutely not. I said that to ardoch to the automa from the eighth floor. If the treasurer and the mayor and her designee or the nD nD Director of Human Services want to work together in conjunction to roll out this program under The department Human Services, hey, go for it. Let's get it done.

Sharon Tyus, 1st ward Alderwoman  2:35:05
Okay, and what was your main concern with the mayor's proposal, if you could tell me,

John Collins-Muhammad, 21st Alderman  2:35:13
there was no plan, there was no planning process with them, I suppose. It didn't say it and say, lay down who can get the funds but didn't say who was actually eligible. Under her proposal, half of my ward, right, won't be able to apply with a certain with a certain was strict stuff that was placed in it, proving income loss proving a direct financial hardship from COVID-19. I mean, that's hard, that's hard to do, especially when you come from, especially when you come from an economically struggling neighborhood, like the neighborhoods that I represent in a 21st is just it'd be, it'd be an undue hardship to even to even apply to get the cash assistance. Like there was no plan in place whatsoever. This, this amendment lays out a plan. And it directs the executive branch to to roll out that plan.

Sharon Tyus, 1st ward Alderwoman  2:36:17
So I have a kind of a thing about directing the executive branch, because I don't think we can, we can authorize them. But if we start to direct the now think we cross over, and I've been saying this for years, we've crossed over from being the legislative branch, and so we can't direct themselves. I think that's a wording I don't like, but I hear what you're saying. Um, I like I like I said, I like both of those put together. And I would like to see the money doubled. I will say I understand people's caution about having some checks and balances, this whole thing we've had about a moratorium on people being evicted, is I am a landlord, as you know. And I've heard from a lot of other landlords, I had tenants who didn't pay rent, but they were renting furniture, or buying new furniture. And so I've had a lot of landlords say, Hey, this is put me out of business we didn't think through, we didn't put any a checks and balances on this. And I actually start going and looking at other states, like Illinois has a process the set up that makes you have to kind of certify before you get certain funds for rental assistance. And so I do see where there are needs for checks and balances. I also don't understand what you're talking about, because I was furious the way we did the COVID vaccination so like so I called the the governor's office and got my own for my community, because it was so unfair, and then set up a program at Walgreens because everything was dependent on people who have internet, so I had to bargain with Walgreens, so that they would let people walk in and get a vaccination then or come the next day. So we have to be very careful. A lot of times people who are so used to internet access are using. The computers are not aware of the seniors who don't know how to do that, or just people who don't have internet access. And so we have to be cognizant of the fact that there are people who don't, who cannot access in and do not have the ability to prove income majus as we get into these voting IDs, laws, and people want us to prove all your IDs and things but make it so hard for the people who live in certain communities to be able to do that. I mean, even going to make it laws to say you have to have it and then don't have any place nearby where you can be able to get those pieces of proof to prove who you are. So I'm going to sit back and listen, I like both of you all's proposals, I would like it to be put together and work together. And I would like more money. So I'm going to listen to see what other people have to say I do agree with the odd one from the 19th to saying how hard these programs are to get up and started. And I don't think that either the treasurer's office, or the park department, whoever can do that by themselves. So I'm just gonna listen. Thank you, Alderman. I appreciate your effort on this. And I'm going to listen what other people have to say.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  2:39:35
Thank you all. All the one for the 27.

Pamela Boyd, 27th ward Alderwoman  2:39:42
Thank you, Mister. Thank you, Mr. President. It's interesting that Alderwoman Tyus suggested that the merest opposite and Alderman Muhammad work together on this because ironically, it was all A month ago, I said that and I said, Why can't we come to the table, come up with a plan that's gonna benefit the residents that's in the ward and actually see who will be able to receive these dollars. And so I'm gonna get on my soap offer, because I hear Alderwoman Rice, talking about people that don't have inflammation and that kind of stuff. But I guess my thing, I always have to think back to my life. And if if I don't run, right, have you ever had to work two or three jobs make your $5 to $6? An hour?

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  2:40:46
Alderwoman from the 27th was like all the ones from the ATM question play nicely. Oh, the question about one from 27. 

Annie Rice, 8th ward Alderwoman  2:40:56
Yes, 

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  2:40:57
all of them 27. Please proceed.

Pamela Boyd, 27th ward Alderwoman  2:40:59
Okay. And I'm asking this because I hear us constantly say, you know, these people need these funds, and they need to make it. And so I was one of these people. I was one of these people that was out there. And I made choices. There wasn't right at the time, I was young, didn't want to listen. But I knew I had to take care of my kids. And so I didn't work one job, I worked three jobs, and I went to school at night. So I could complete my education and go to college. But I didn't want the frustration as Alderwoman Davis has said, Would DFS or back then we just call them welfare, because of the questions they asked you and how they demean you as a human being. And so I was able to they were saying you can get down so you can get I didn't want it. Because I didn't want people in my business, and trying to demean me and make me feel less than the woman that I was. And so I respect those people that do that. I respect them, they make sure that they stay independent of their sale. But I don't think you realize we have African American seniors that don't even have a birth certificate. So it's not about people from other countries. It's about people within the city of St. Louis. They don't have birth certificates because they were born in a house. They have midwives, they had the Bible as their information to say where they were, and a lot of them don't even know where they are. So what you're stating is what happens to those people. And I just think you all forget about those people. And you keep focusing on things that you forgetting about the people that have been left behind. So you keep saying the MERS build and what she did well, Alderwoman Rice i did approached the mayor's office and asked them to meet with us to try to work this out. So it could be a win win. And they refused. They said no. That's not what we want. This is how we want it. Because this would augmon ty say it and alderman Davis said I don't see no policy, no plan in place. I don't see no rhyme or reason on who's going to get the dollars. And I just think that's reckless in regards to us. And it's money that's just been thrown out there. And the comment I got was, well, if we missed the mark, we can try it again. That's a lot of money to be talking about if we've missed the mark. So I just don't feel comfortable. I'm with Alderwoman Tyus and Alderwoman. Davis, I think we need to come to the table. What I suggested in the beginning to come to the table, come up with a plan so we can put it out there so we can make sure we got checks and balances. Because I think our city is really lacking in accountability. And I'm just nervous about that. So it really wasn't a question it was really a statement I'm sorry cuz I just got on a beach but it's you know, I'm just like, we have to quit acting like this is our Willie Daly is serious.  And we're talking about people's lives. And so yeah, that $500 might pay they rent but then what's next? And that's all I'm saying. You know, I'm just really nervous. I think we need to do a wraparound piece to help people not just pay the rent today. And then what about next month so that's that's where I stand. Thank you. Thank you.

Annie Rice, 8th ward Alderwoman  2:44:56
Which would you mind if I responded to No, it was just me too. Okay, so I would say I highlighted the undocumented immigrants

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  2:45:05
all along for me hold for a second, I thought the Alderwoman from 27 said, Did you say no,

Pamela Boyd, 27th ward Alderwoman  2:45:11
no, I said, I don't have problem with her speaking. Go ahead go. The Alderwoman.

Annie Rice, 8th ward Alderwoman  2:45:22
I just took I highlighted that piece, because you know that that is my area of expertise in my, you know, in my former profession with as an immigration attorney. And so that was just a piece that was different in this proposal from the from the mayor's proposal. And so that's why I highlighted that. But  I did want to speak to also the bill were built to does include benefits navigators, for seniors and for others who don't. So people who don't have those resources. So we do have other outreach mechanisms in the bill, to try to meet those needs of people. Because I know, it's not just undocumented people that have challenges in finding those documents. We have weird, this package of for Bill Two, has an immense amount of benefits to folks that are available. And this part of that benefits navigators is to help people get to all of the pieces that they need, right. And then this money is designed to stabilize people after the pandemic. And we can use some of it to look forward to the future and hopefully bring people up to a firmer, firmer foundation and then move forward from there. But you know, this is all of this has to be targeted to pandemic related losses. And so that's why we're trying to work within those guidelines of the ARPA funds to meet that specific need. And then use that to you know, maybe it is expanding the programs that we offer or finding less restrictive ways, right ways that don't require people to have to divulge all of that information as well to move forward on. So we're we're trying to bring up the safety net of the government. And this is one of those mechanisms to do that.  So thank you, Alderwoman. I appreciate it.

Pamela Boyd, 27th ward Alderwoman  2:46:58
No problem. That's all I have with the President. Right.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  2:47:04
Thank you. I'm ready for alderman from the 22nd. 

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  2:47:11
Thank you, Mr. President. But I believe that all learn from a 26 was before me. So I will yield to her. 

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  2:47:17
All the one from the 26. 

John Collins-Muhammad, 21st Alderman  2:47:23
It looked like she stepped out Mr. President. Yeah, that's why I go to the alderman from 2009. From 22nd. Okay. She, she's back. Oh, one from the 26. 

Shameem Clark-Hubbard, 26th ward Alderwoman 26  2:47:42
I'm sorry, my hand was up for another reason, this task now I need 20 seconds.

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  2:47:49
Okay. Mmm, hmm. Well, I'm not that excited about direct cash assistance payments. I don't think it's, it will be administered fairly. You know, when I think about people in need, I think about how the federal government did all the stimulus checks. I think about how there are a lot of people in need in the city of St. Louis, people pay taxes. And if there was a way that we could collect data on everybody who file an income tax refund, and they met a certain guideline I can get with that. You know, that would make sense to me. So we would target those particular individuals.  As I listened to these cash payments, I'm kind of confused as to what do we exactly use them for? So I'm gonna ask my colleague from the 21st, if he would yield and understand his compromise with the mayor's office, but with Alma, from the 21st year

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  2:48:58
on infantry first reveal the question to the alderman from the 22nd.

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  2:49:02
Yes.  And thank you, alderman. So, give me some examples of how you see these funds being used by the targeted group.

John Collins-Muhammad, 21st Alderman  2:49:17
Well, I would hope that I will hope that as a resident of my ward, they will take me out for a nice steak dinner. I'm kidding. Of course. Hopefully, they are using this to to make ends meet to pay their bills. Again, I know 500 is not a lot of money. But it can be a determinant factor of whether someone walks into a dark house that walk into a dark house or whether they don't have air, they don't have food on their table or in their refrigerator. I know this will help. In I heard the crowds of my residents on 21st Ward, who said filing dollars will help me Sure they helped me today and it helped me tomorrow. So hopefully they They will make ends meet, and they will make the best utilization of it and do what they need to do to take care of their families in their children if they have. 

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  2:50:09
Right. Um, and so I we have a safety net right now to cover people if they have utility issues. So we have funding for utility assistance already. We have funding for mortgage and rental assistance already. We have, you know, all kinds of sites across the city for food distribution to meet the food insecurity needs. So I'm just trying to figure out, what problem are we trying to really solve here.  and I would just go back and echo a lot that the 20th would say it. Without a detailed plan, when you got some analytics, as far as you know, who's out there, how many people are really in need.  This almost just looks like, let's just throw some money out there. It makes some people happy. But we really don't understand the magnitude of the problem. And I guess I just want somebody to present to me, you know, some data on how many people I mean, 10,000, people's seems arbitrary to me. Because we just want to spend, you know, $5 million, you know, 10,000 people is how many people have 500 bucks a piece that we're going to spend it on, and understand people in great need right now.  When this first came about it was I was like people, we're going to actually die if we didn't pass this board bill by June 30th. And I haven't heard of anybody actually dying, because we haven't spit, you know, pass this board bill.  And I hear what the author in front of first Ward says, and I like the comments, you know, that she said, and I like the effort you're making, you know, we should have some type of compromise here. But as the along from the 27th, said, you know, the unwillingness, or the lack of outreach from the mayor's office to be able to talk to us so that we can have a better understanding of what's going on. It makes it difficult for us to just say, Oh, yeah, just gonna fire me because, you know, maybe they maybe 5 million is not enough. Maybe they need 50 million, no, maybe they need 100 million. Are we prepared to spend 100 million, why 5 million, but we have nothing to really justify that number with that somebody or anybody has made known to me. I certainly like you know, your amendment over the one offered by the mayor's office, because it only makes sense to me that if we're going to spend this money, spend it in Health and Human Services, aka air, the welfare office, I think with almost from the first call there, but it's the Health and Human Services Office, because they know about this population. That's their wheelhouse. This is not the wheelhouse of the treasurer. I don't see how putting all this money in the treasurer's office makes good sense to me. I mean, certainly they do fight financial transactions and what have you. Okay, that's great, but they're not the ones to really wrap their arms around these individuals, what I keep hearing people like my colleague from the eighth Ward wraparound services, and, and really, you know, basically getting a personal relationship with these innovators, that's not for a trip. That is something in Health and Human Services.  So I appreciate, you know, if this needs to happen has to happen. I appreciate moving it from the treasurer's office to Health and Human Services. And also,  if they probably don't have the capacity right now to do what they need to do, but guess what, there are a lot of organizations already doing it. They're already doing this good work. So there's an opportunity for them to partner with them. They can do an RFP and say, Hey, you know, we have this $5 million. And we know you know, here the target population, I can you help the city do it. But see, those require more public discussion? To me. I think that should be some conversation that is held in a committee, whether it's health and human services under the Health Committee, or whether it's in hertz, because these are the funds are located. Um,  I'm not sure we have to do this right away. I don't see the sense of urgency. Of course, I understand. People can use 500. I'm gonna tell you, I don't know anybody who can't use $500.  I know money back. They can't use $500. But I think it's our responsibility to make sure that we're solving some basic needs food, shelter, All right roof over their head, out of the elements, lights are on. The air is working with 100 degrees outside. Those are major things that I think we should be focusing on. And guess what? It's in the board bill already. So at the risk of sounding kind of mean, this bad man, I was almost as like a, just a slush fund on money to just do government giveaways. And I know that's not the intended purpose. But we haven't done our due diligence,  we have no idea how many people out there that we need to do outreach to, to make sure that we are successful in the delivery of these services, I really think that we should back up a little bit. There's another board bill that has been introduced that we can pass in September, that gives us two months to really work on this issue, and come back and have a solid number, the number of people we're targeting, how much money is what the need is? And really do it right. See, this is unlike Home Repair, where we already know how many people on the waiting list are already know what the average cost of doing these repairs are. So we can come up with that magic number. But there's no data that has been given. That shows this, we're talking about undocumented people we're talking about on house people, I'm gonna submit this to you. I know young men that are staying with friends. They just kind of bounce back and forth with relatives and friends, because they're unhappy homes, right? So they should qualify. But is there an ID card that says, hey, I'm homeless, that we show to demonstrate our need and our qualifications for our program? Never heard of that. I don't think we need to do this in haste. I think there's an opportunity for us to sit down collectively, and really think this through. Sincerely. I'm gonna ask the Alderwoman from the eighth Ward if she was here for questions, but I think she might have some answers to some of my concerns,

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  2:57:36
will yield a question to alderman for the 22nd? Sorry.

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  2:57:41
Also Alderwoman? I know you've been dealing with us, some of our colleagues have been dealing with the unhoused population for quite some time now, especially since the pandemic. How are we quantifying how many people are on housed?

Annie Rice, 8th ward Alderwoman  2:57:57
So generally, that's done by the point in time count. That's the official count of how many folks we have. Otherwise, I'm throughout the year when that you know, that count is is once a year. And other than that, it would be a survey of where folks are in our shelters or with our service providers?

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  2:58:15
And how do you imagine that we will go out and target them and say, Hey, we have this $500 debit card, you know, that you can probably, you know, use to help yourself out?

Christine Ingrassia, 6th ward Alderwoman  2:58:25
Sure, we've got a lot of great partners that have outreach workers that have been out on the streets with these folks. Within a year. I mean, know pretty much everyone who's out there by name and are able to connect them to resources, kind of the same way that St. Patrick's center was able to target vaccinations for the unhoused. And, and that kind of thing.

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  2:58:44
So so how do we identify the people that sleeping on their families count for their friend's couch that just kind of bounced back and forth? How do we capture that data?

Christine Ingrassia, 6th ward Alderwoman  2:58:55
Or Yeah, that is more difficult, because those folks are if they're not accessing services, or they're not sleeping out on the streets, then they're not quantifying those counts. So the outreach, you know, the the door to door canvassing, the, you know, slps deals with this problem a lot with students who are moving around from couch to couch, it's it's a tricky process to try to follow people. But that doesn't mean it doesn't mean that they are inaccessible. I think it's, it's harder to count, but I don't think it's impossible.

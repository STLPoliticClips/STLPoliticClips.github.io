Shane Cohn, Alderman ward 25: I want to thank my colleague from the 11th ward for bringing that issue up. I also am frankly surprised at the lack of understanding of history and systems of governance from elected representatives. Communism isn’t a system of government, it’s a political ideology, it’s an idea. I am a proud Democrat but this feels awful a lot like McCarthyism in the 1950s. To punish and exclude people based off of ideas is unamerican.

I think that yes, there were atrocities certainly under Totalitarian regimes, as my colleague from the 11th ward pointed out. As the speaker, who was referencing the Revolution in Russia and the Bolsheviks, and the tragedies that happened underneath Totalitarian Communism in Russia, or the USSR at the time, I think it’s also important to note that part of the reason that Red Revolution happened in Russia was because people were dying underneath the Totalitarian regime, underneath a royal regime, the czar.

There were 900 - 1.5 million people that died underneath Czar Nicholas the second, which partly led to that revolution. There was a representative government that was trying to be established at the time, the Czar did not want to recognize it. Therefore, it ended up in revolution.

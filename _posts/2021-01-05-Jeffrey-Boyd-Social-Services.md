Jeffrey Boyd, Alderman ward 22: I don’t hear any organization that’s making an outcry about they need extra funding for social services so that can directly focus on their needs. I think it’s sexy to say we need to put more money in mental health, we need to put more money into these social service programs. But, I don’t hear the outcry.

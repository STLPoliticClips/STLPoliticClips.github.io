[inaudible cross talk]

Ald. Rice: Mr. President, if I could please finish 

Pres. Reed: Alderwoman, hold on for a second. We're not we're not going to have

Tamikka Hubbard, Alderwoman ward 5: Point of Order, Mr President! [audio gets muted]

Pres. Reed: Alderwoman from the fifth, please state your point of order. You need to unmute yourself. 

Ald. Hubbard: The Alderwoman from the 15th just put up a sign as if we're out at a protest rally or something. And it says stop silencing women. I feel that goes against the level of decorum, we should be showing as a body out here for the public eye. 

If that's the case, we all can put up signs and I just don't feel that that's appropriate. It's the wrong space for it. That's all I have. Thank you.

Pres. Reed: Thank you alderwoman from the fifth point of order well taken. Alderwoman from the 15 please refrain from holding up signs. 

Dr. Megan Green, Alderwoman ward 15: Your staff needs to unmute me and let. [audio muted]

Pres. Reed: During the meeting. And no, you will not be unmuted until you're recognized to talk. This is still a legislative body. We're not at a concert. We're not a get together in someone's house. We are a legislative branch of government and you will carry yourself, everybody's gonna have to carry themselves with that right.

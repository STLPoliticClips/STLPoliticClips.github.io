Annie Rice, Alderwoman ward 8: The special taxing districts, I know this has been brought up and this was brought up to me by one of my own Special Taxing Districts. They report back to the Board of Directors all the time on what their technology is doing and they don’t think that this is any more significant of a burden than is there. 

I will also point out that the Auditor, the State Auditor in Missouri said that we have significant problems with our special taxing districts. That there’s a lack of transparency, a lack of documentation that’s there. Trying to find out some of what’s happening in my own ward, who's on the board, whose term is current, what’s the enabling ordinances… It's a difficult process.

Quite frankly, if we’re going to be asking them to use taxpayer dollars, then I think this transparency needs types of reporting that are really important.

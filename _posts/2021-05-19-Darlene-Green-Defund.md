Darlene Green, Comptroller: So this yearâ€™s budget again, the new administration has recommended -- or repeated the recommendation -- to reduce over time by $2 million. As you just stated in addition, they have also looked at the number of open unfilled positions that have been funded and decided to no longer fund those positions in this year's budget. 

Instead, [they decided to] fund alternative public safety prevention methods to help fight violent crime and to reduce crime overall in our city with some transformative changes that we in the last several years have not taken advantage of.

With regard to an unfilled position, it is my position to say that that position would never fight crime because it is unfilled. There is no person, there is no one there walking the beat.

Bill Stephens, Alderman ward 12: You know, even if they're 20 years old, one thing I want to point out that they'll have as an amenity is air conditioning, right? That's something that we don't have at City Hall, for example. And as I look at photos of the interior, aldermen from the seventh, I mean, we've got marble floors, we have updated lighting, we have all these other things, and I look at these photos. And then I look in my neighborhood, which is one of the most beautiful wards in the entire city. I'm absolutely biased. I cannot present that as fact, but it's true. 

And I look at my neighbors who are having issues keeping their air on or paying their personal property tax. And I just think that I mean, this is a Hilton Alderman from the Seventh that we're offering a tax break to.

Yes, the pandemic was, was insurmountable in some ways and for numerous industries, but as I look at the Proposed resolution, and as I look at these photos of the interior, some of which are available on their website, so on and so forth. I, I cannot support this, you know, and were it a truly blighted area, I think I could throw my support behind it.

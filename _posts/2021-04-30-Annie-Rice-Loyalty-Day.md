Annie Rice, Alderwoman ward 8: Currently, in the Missouri Legislature, we are seeing bills that prevent protests. That would indemnify drivers from driving through lines of protests of people who are in the streets, and would further criminalize from blocking the streets. Things that happen all the time here in the City of St. Louis when people are speaking out for their rights.

We’re also seeing a ban on frankly, racial correct education that is coming through. Folks trying to say that the only history that we are allowed to teach to our children is the white centered history that we have always been taught. 

I think there’s a move now throughout the country to be more accurate and to be more honest of who we are and how we have gotten here. So I think, for me especially, in light of those things and in light of where we are as a country, this gives me great pause. 

It is not because I do not welcome the foreigners, or because I dont welcome the immigrant, I am an immigration attorney. I have personally helped numerous citizens get their citizens. I am thrilled by it, but that diversity of thought, that diversity of opinion and ability to criticize, even new immigrants to the United States are welcome to criticize us. This rings as a problem in a time when we are more and more polarized, when we are more and more separated into camps, and to declare loyalty to something through a day.

Frankly, the Red Scare upended people’s lives. So people who were not communist, people who were not part of the Community Party, were called out as communist. Their lives, their livelihoods, their homes were threatened. Just to be honest where this comes from, there are other ways that we can celebrate our unity, celebrate our diversity, celebrate our culture. This frankly is not one of them.

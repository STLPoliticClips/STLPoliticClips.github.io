Aimee Wehmeier, Stimulus Advisory Board Direct Relief Subcommittee: So, based on the first priority, so based on the data, our first priority is meeting critical health needs. And just a few statistics. 

We know that those already living in the margins have most severely been impacted by the public health crisis and the result of the economic fallout. We know that four in 10 adults reported symptoms that maybe anxiety and depression during the pandemic. 28% of city residents have completed vaccinations, which shows that we still have a ways to go. And rates of community violence have increased throughout the pandemic, which 2021 is already outpacing 2024 homicide rates.

Okay, so the priority one funding recommendations. Let's go back one slide. 

So the Stimulus Advisory Board Relief Subcommittee recommends that money be allotted toward mobile vaccination clinics, public education, and community canvassing efforts to increase vaccination rates in low income communities, hiring community health workers and establishing a fund for retention and recruitment of home health care workers and direct threats, direct support professionals to support individuals with disabilities, behavioral health providers, and finally, evidence based community violence intervention programs, such as Cure Violence.

Ed Bryant, Stimulus Advisory Board: Thanks, Aimee. Again, my name is Ed Bryant, I'm with the Stimulus Advisory Board, I'm going to be talking about two of our priorities. Priority two, which is around funding for housing and rental assistance and funding. Priority three, which is support for our unhoused neighbors. 

One of the things that we have been informed by the data around this area of housing and utility assistance is that we know the St Louisians are having a difficult time to achieve and maintain housing stability. And also city residents have already identified housing as their single biggest budgetary cost and housing remains a massive barrier to economic security. And in third, the city has had some challenges to disburse funds on a timely and accessible manner. 

So our recommendation from the Direct Relief subcommittee is that stimulus funds should be dispersed and centralized in essentially a trusted partner and an online application portal be created in the city and invest in door to door outreach and case management. Second, that a fund be created to assist those at risk of losing their homes due to being behind in property taxes. Third, expanding legal representation in eviction proceedings as an intervention to reduce evictions and homelessness. Fourth, providing housing and utility assistance.

Ed Bryant, Stimulus Advisory Board: The third funding priority is aid to our unhoused residents and neighbors. So one of the things that we saw was that as soon as the eviction moratorium ended 1000s of St. Louis residents became homeless. In July of 2020 1,260 individuals were experiencing homelessness and around 30% of those individuals were unsheltered on a single night. Black residents are nearly four times as likely to be homeless as white residents. 

So our recommendations are that there'll be an establishment of an intentional encampment for those who prefer to live outside or are not ready for shelter for a shelter environment, the establishment of a safe haven to provide a 24/7 walk in option for those seeking shelter. That there'll be a community outreach to assist in assessing services, case management, wraparound services, bridge housing to support those who are newly evicted or leaving the justice system and finding temporary housing at a hotel or motel. Rapid Rehousing to provide immediate funding for rent, utilities and case management. Finally, a permanent supportive housing for affordable housing assistance with support services to address the needs of chronically homeless individuals.

Dr. Megan Green, Alderwoman ward 15, Stimulus Advisory Board: Thank you, Ed. I'm alderwoman Megan Ellyia Green, and I'm going to walk through the next three funding priorities as well as the implementation of these priorities. 

So, the next priority we have is economic relief. We know that businesses and households in our community are still struggling to pay their bills. With the state of Missouri blocking federal unemployment benefits, households and businesses that are suddenly losing some of these benefits are going to have some different and evolving needs. We also know that we need to support workforce development to make sure that the skills that people have match what is needed in the job market.  We also recognize that there's been a growing gap in access to early care and education programs and in the expense that goes along with those programs. 

So, the stimulus advisory board Direct Relief subcommittee is recommending that funds be directed toward small business and nonprofit grants, restaurants, venues, other hospitality sectors and businesses. were recommending the developing a technical assistance hub for minority and women owned businesses to provide tax filing assistance, web design, legal advice, things like that. 

We are recommending investing in expansion of Workforce Development capacity to again make sure that workforce needs are matching the skills that workers have in our community. And we are pushing for establishing a city unemployment worker assistance program to provide a one time $350 to $500 payment to the estimated 10,000 St. Louis city residents who are being impacted by the state of Missouri blocking federal unemployment benefits. And last, we are recommending expanding capacity for early childhood and early care and education in our city.

Dr. Megan Green, Alderwoman ward 15, Stimulus Advisory Board:  The next priority is youth programming. We know that about 42% of youth in our city live in households who are below the poverty level and only about a third of our city's youth right now participate in out of school programming. And so we need to figure out ways to engage our youth in other ways. 

Some of the ways that we can do that is through summer youth programs through jobs programs that expand beyond the summers and through expanding opportunities that exist at our rec centers. 

So, we are wanting to expand our partnership with St. Louis Public Schools and the stimulus advisory board Direct Relief subcommittee is recommending that we funds, Summer Youth Programs and Summer Youth jobs that we expand youth programming that is at our recreation centers and create programming that is focused on variety of different areas to entice more kids to want to participate in that programming. 

We're advocating and adding social workers to our rec centers to address some of the ongoing behavioral and mental health needs of young people that we've only seen get worse throughout the pandemic. We want to make rec centers access points for vaccination efforts, especially as more of our youth are eligible to receive the vaccine. We want to support the gateway go program, which provides free public transit to use so that they can access recreational activities and youth jobs.

Dr. Megan Green, Alderwoman ward 15, Stimulus Advisory Board: And then just a summary of everything that we've talked about today, one through six plus our administrative costs. We have a total of $68 million that we are allocating today through the three funding sources that we outlined at the beginning, critical health needs housing assistance, support for our unhoused neighbors, economic relief, huge jobs and expanding internet access. And that's it from the Direct Relief subcommittee.

Lewis Reed, President of the Board of Alderman: I will not be able to vote in support of the reduction in uniformed officers today. Only because when I look at it, it is hard to tell how we are going to make up for the purchasing of fewer work hours within the police department. For that reason, I will not be voting to support that amendment today. But, at the board of alderman we will continue to make it to meet all of the goals that amendment brings. I’m assuming it’s going to pass today without my vote, but I'm not prepared to vote for it today, I don’t have enough information.

Tishaura Jones, Mayor: Well, if you have any questions, I did request that Chief Hayden join us today. We did work with the Chief on this particular number, and Chief would you like to give us a bit of some background on how we came to this number and some of our discussion?

John Hayden, Chief of Police: Surely, so basically Dr. Isom had spoken to me about how many personnel we could actually do without, and the point is do without if we had them. I think that everybody has heard me talk about, probably since I have been Chief, we probably started off somewhere around 130 officers that we were regularly short. Then that grew to about 150 or so, just over the past year or so. I’ve been regularly saying that we are short 150 officers. In other words, it’s a theoretical group of people. Somebody might say how does that affect your current operations? It actually wouldn’t affect current operations at all, because it’s people that I don’t have.</p>

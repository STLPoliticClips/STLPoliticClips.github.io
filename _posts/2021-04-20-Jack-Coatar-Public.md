Lewis Reed, President of the Board of Alderman: If we’re referring a bill or resolution or anything like that to committee.
 
Jack Coatar, Alderman 7th ward: Understood. Thank you Mr. President. As the rules committee chair, I would ask today that we just pass this rule. I think this makes sense. It’s a bad look to be standing here saying that one of the first acts we take as a new body is to say we don’t want public input at our committee hearings. 

Frankly, we already take public testimony on the vast majority of the bills passed down here as required by law. Development related bills that require public input. Doing that for, a handful pieces of legislation or resolutions, I don't think will be overly burdensome. I think as written, this amendment, this proposed rule change still gives ample discretion to the chair of that committee to limit the time somebody may speak. 

As written, I don't also believe it requires, you could have multiple committee meetings on the same bills. Only one of those committee meetings necessarily requires public testimony. If it’s the will of the body to send it to committee we’ll give it a fair hearing and probably take public input on it, but I also think we could probably just pass this today and move on with more pressing matters.

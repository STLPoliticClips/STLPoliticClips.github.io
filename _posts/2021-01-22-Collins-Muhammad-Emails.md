John Collins-Muhammad, Alderman ward 21: Like my collegues I have received numerous emails telling me to vote no on this board bill. Exactly, it was, I wrote the number down. I received 213 emails from people saying vote no on this board bill.

Now, none of them were from my ward. In fact, out of that 213, I went through a -- and its not an accurate database, this is just an example -- out of that 213 people, I ran 67 names in a voter database, just to see if they were residents of the City of St. Louis, and absolutely none of them were.

Now the remaining others, could be residents of the City of St. Louis, who knows? But, I ran 60 plus names, just to see if they even live in North City where crime is absolutely a problem, but murder is the real problem.

Cara Spencer, Alderwoman ward 20: I rise in support of this bill, and I would like to commend the Alderwoman from the 8th for taking a leadership role in protecting our citizen’s civil rights. As the Alderman from the 24th pointed out, very appropriately, civil rights are not pesky little things that we should be trying to step aside or brush under the rug.

I share concerns brought up by my colleagues that the Director of our Public Safety Department, Chief Technology Officer, and others haven’t weighed in. Frankly, the fact that our city is gathering an immense amount of data on our citizens without privacy plans in place, is a failure of those folks who have raised concerns at this late hour.

Those concerns outweigh my concerns of the lack of involvement in this particular plan; given that we’ve had this before us for some time now.

We are barreling towards being a city that has helicopters collecting an infinite amount of data about each and every one of us without any provision about what we’re doing with that data, who has access to it, and under what circumstances. 

This lack of protection of our basic civil rights, it’s not new. This is not a new concept to our city, or to the Board of Alderman since the time I’ve been down here, we’ve been talking about this. At that time, our now clerk, the honorable Clerk Kennedy was here among us at the Board, and he sponsored very similar legislation. I know, I was a cosponsor at that time. This legislation was also supported by the ACLU and also raised concerns by the administration. These concepts again, are not new to us or our city.

I’m not in favor of doing nothing. We’re elected here to serve and to protect our citizens and protecting their civil rights is our obligation as elected officials. With that, again, I commend the Alderwoman of the 8th for taking a leadership role here. I urge my colleagues to support protecting our citizens’ civil rights rather than simply doing nothing.

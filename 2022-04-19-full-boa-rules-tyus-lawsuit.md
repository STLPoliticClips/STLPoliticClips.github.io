Tyus 15:07: So I was coming here with a one word, removal in our word, our rules, which was to remove the word continuous in before seniority. I've been talking about this for a while now. And I was hoping that we did not have to go to court. But I am now and I'm going to do it because that's a word that was put into effect that affects me and my community. 

Because this Board of Aldermen 20 years ago, affected me and my community, they violated the charter. They violated the Voting Rights Act, they moved my ward, they took away our right to vote. And so there was nothing that we did wrong it's everything that these chambers did wrong. And 2020, the president has admitted pretty much you all know this. But under the last redistricting, they put all of the 20th Ward back together, what they did was really wrong. And I've been here talking about it. 

So there's no way that my community could get continuous seniority or I, I didn't lose, nobody could beat me. I didn't quit. This board violated my rights. And every time you put continuous seniority back in your rules, you're violating my right and that of my community. Now there was a former alderperson said to me, why don't you just move down to what they now call the 20th. Ward, because even if I moved and kept my seniority, my community didn't keep my seniority, which is what you're supposed to get when you keep electing the same person. And that's what my community had done. And that's what it's done. And so I'm asking this board to take that out. 


Tyus rundown of what happened

Jeffrey Boyd 27:20: this ever go to court? The redistricting of 2001?

Tyus: No, it didn't go to court. But every time you pass this continuance in your to you renew it, I didn't carry it over here again. You it's going to go to court now because I'm going to walk right over to the court of equity. And I will, the redistricting itself is illegal read our charter. If you live in your spot. Every four years, you get to vote. I got elected again by in 1999. So in 2003, if we had not done any legal redistricting, we would have got to vote. That's illegal. Under our charter, it's illegal for you to have rules that discriminate against not only me, but my community. That whole thing was illegal. And the former mayor talks about we tried to offer her a deal. I don't have to make a deal about am I a woman? Am I black? Do I have a right to be treated the same way? Under the Constitution, US state? Or the charter? Or our rules? I have a right and my community does. 

If you could show me a way that my community and I would have had the same right as everybody else, then I wouldn't be standing here. You know, I'm a fair person. It didn't have to go to court. What I'm telling you is that was done wrong. It was wrong. It was illegal. I went in, I didn't even get some of it so much because I got sick after they had done it. Because I was just could not believe that as hard as I had worked and turned my community around. So that the community that had been losing population was not that all around me. 

Your Ward lost 4000 Some people to the Fourth Ward lost 4000 And something people the 21st Ward last 3000. And some people have 18th Ward last 3,001st Ward, but the 20th Ward did not. Who thinks that's a good idea to destroy and tear off something like that, and bringing up that point about if it went to court. It ain't going to court today when you try to leave that as a continuous seniority. What I'm talking about is right, in fairness, we talk about in the caucus all the time about right and fairness. Well, I know you want to keep your seniority.

So you and the six people in front of me say well, we didn't do that reparations. The people who we talked to about reparations also didn't do that. But they are the benefit of it. You have a seniority because you're the benefit of something that was done racist and illegal against my community. 


Jeffrey Boyd “Not illegal just shrewd”

Jeffrey Boyd 37:58: what I saw happening was more of a political chess move, because you're right, they were not able to beat you. In the 20th. Ward. They were so the only way to beat you with to be a was to shift that Ward somewhere else, which was a strategically, politically, that was a shrewd move.

Sharon Tyus: It was not it was an illegal move.

Boyd: But your lawyer, a smart lawyer. 

Tyus: I Appreciate that. 

Boyd: But we're not in a court of law. If it had gone to court and the court said, Hey, that was illegal, then we would be obligated to go back and right a wrong. Right. But it did not go to court. We're only going by your word that it was illegal. I don't it wasn't fair. And I think there's a difference between illegal and unfair. And, of course, you know what I always say about being a lawyer. But that's my thought,

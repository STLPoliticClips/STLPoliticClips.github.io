Lewis Reed 33:10: Alderman Vaccaro, I appreciate the work you've done. And I'm sorry that in this new world of cancel culture, which is become chic, and the in thing to do, that they've chosen to spend time attacking you so and apologize, you know, as a resident of the city of St. Louis, that they're doing, and very, very happy to support your bill today.

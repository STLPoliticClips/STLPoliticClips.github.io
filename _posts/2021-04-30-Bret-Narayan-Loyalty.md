Bret Narayan, Alderman ward 24: This came into kind of common, it came into being at the height of the Red Scare 50 years ago, more than 50 years ago. I think that this particular resolution is probably about 50 years too late. Given the fact that there’s just so much push back to this, I’m going to be a present vote.

That being said, I think that we can all agree Red Dawn is an awesome movie and if the Soviet’s come over the top and we need to do something about it. I don’t know why we’re still arguing about this.

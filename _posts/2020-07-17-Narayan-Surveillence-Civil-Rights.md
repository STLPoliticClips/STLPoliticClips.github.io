Bret Narayan, Alderman ward 24: It’s a bit disconcerting to me to hear some of my colleagues talk about civil liberties and rights like they’re just some pesky thing that we have to deal with or overcome. I know several times throughout my life, including when I swore in to become the Alderman of the 24th Ward, I took an oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States of America and that includes the 4th Amendment.

The idea that we should disregard civil liberties and civil rights because they’re “inconvenient” is baffling to me. It gets to the very heart -- this bill gets to the very heart to the consent of the governed and having a government of the people, by the people, and for the people. 

If people don't know the technology that are being used to surveille them, then they can't okay them or say that they have a problem with them.

It becomes an unknown, unknown.

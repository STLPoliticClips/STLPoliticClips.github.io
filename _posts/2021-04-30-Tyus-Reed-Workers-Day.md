Lewis Reed, President of the Board of Alderman: Alderwoman from the first

Sharon Tyus, Alderwoman ward 1:  President and members of the board, I also request that my name be placed on this resolution. 

Madam clerk, please make note of that.

T: Also, International Workers Day is, we need International Worker’s Year. I think we found out how important many of the workers that we took for granted, but this pandemic has many people that we didn't give the credit, grocery store workers, janitors, custodians, the teachers, the people who now have to teach their own children then said “oh my god I don't know what to do”. These are all very important people.

Workers are, in fact, important. Unions are important. A lot of people don’t know what labor has done. Ya know, they don’t know about the many hours people use to have to work, that people use to have to work, so they take that for granted.

Are unions perfect? No, they are not. No organization that you’re in is perfect, but what you do is work on making it more perfect. That’s what we talk about in “a more perfect union” for the United States.

They weren't talking about labor unions, but we continue to work and to add things and to make it a better place. If you see a problem with something, you work on that.

Sharon Tyus, Alderwoman ward 1: There was much ado, and I didnt get to address it about the last resolution, the previous resolution that we had about people coming to testify. If you don’t want your people to not be able to testify, you wanna put on the consent calendar, make sure you get twenty votes before you do that.

Otherwise, put it on the regular calendar. Don’t try to blame it on somebody else. Somebody posted that I didn’t want people to talk

Carol Howard, Alderwoman ward 14: Point of order.

Ald. Tyus: I do not want to stop people from talking. I want them to be able to talk

Lewis Reed, President of the Board of Alderman: Alderwoman from the 14th, please state your point of order.

Ald. Howard: This has nothing to do with the resolution that is under to discussion

Pres. Reed: Point of order well taken, Alderwoman from the first, keep your comments germane to the 

[cross-talk, inaudible]

Ald. Tyus: I was going to that. So, I’m still going to go back to that point because I was not finished. I still want people to talk

Pres. Reed: Alderwoman from the fourteenth, you have an opportunity to do that in open public after the meeting, but as you know, that subject matter isn’t germane to this. 

Ald. Tyus: You don’t know where I’m going with it. I’m still, once,

[inaudible cross-talk]

Ald. Tyus: But it is not, I’m going to say right now

Pres. Reed: You are on discussion of previous 

Ald. Tyus: When you finish with it, I’m going to finish my point because it goes directly to this

[inaudible cross-talk]

Ald. Tyus: You just wanna try to quiet me and you’re not.

[inaudible cross-talk]

Pres. Reed: Alderwoman, look.


Video 3:

Ald. Tyus: Look? That is not no, don’t ‘look’... I hear your point then I’m going to move on. So you can keep arguing all you want to.

Pres. Reed: No, no, no, no

[inaudible cross-talk] 

Ald. Tyus: Yes you are. Don’t ‘look’ me. I don’t tell you that Mr. President. I am Alderwoman, not ‘look’. I am not your child, don’t talk to me like your child. I am not your child, don’t talk to me like your child.

Pres. Reed: Alderwoman, you know that was not---

Ald. Tyus: I accepted your (point of order) and I’m moving on and I’m still going to say what I am going to say

Pres. Reed: Please move on, but again---

Ald. Tyus: You don’t know, I’m finished with that, and I’m moving on. 

Pres. Reed: Okay, move on then.

Ald. Tyus: But then you don’t tell me ‘look’, I’m not your child.

Pres. Reed: I wasn’t, my god, Alderwoman…

[inaudible cross-talk]

Ald. Tyus: I am older than you, do not address me like that.

Pres. Reed: Alderwoman, please continue.

Ald. Tyus: Please continue, Mr. President, please be respectful. I heard you… 

[inaudible cross-talk]

Ald. Tyus: I just mentioned that to get to my point.

Pres. Reed: Get to your point.

Ald. Tyus:Thank you very much. Oftentimes, unions people have tried to quiet people down, keep them from speaking up, that’s why you have unions. That’s why you have labor movements. Because people will use bullying tactics to try to make sure that people who oppose them, or who want their worker’s rights, don’t get a chance to have that. So, that’s why you need unions.

There’s a lot of tactics that are used to do that sort of thing. You try to give people extra rights, while you take things away from other people. That ought to be stopped on all levels. Wherever you work at, that should not be at the Board of Alderman. That should not be at the grocery store. That should not be any place.

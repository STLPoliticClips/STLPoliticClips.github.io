Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman: Alderman Vaccaro, I appreciate the work you’ve done. I’m sorry that in this new world of cancel culture, that it’s become chic and the in thing to do, that they’ve chosen to spend time attacking you. 

I apologize as a resident of the City of St. Louis. I’m very, very happy to support your bill.

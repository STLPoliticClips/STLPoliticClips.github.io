Sharon Tyus, Alderwoman ward 1: I heard some talk about funding and I've been having trouble with my video, it went off several times, is there a problem with who is funding this particular operation?

Tom Oldenburg, Alderman ward 16: Is there a problem? Alderwoman, I don’t know, because I’ve always put the onus on the contractor/vendor who said we have relationships with the private foundation, enterprises that would look to fund this. So, I’ve always taken that as well, we’ll try to deliver a city contract and you show up with the money, and execute on it with the police department.

Ald. Tyus: So we don’t know right now who would be funding the contract?

Ald. Oldenburg: Nope. We do not know that

Ald. Tyus: Well I’ll give you an example, when the mayor was a city alderman, and I first came back here, we got Soldiers Memorial done. I sat on a committee -- tourism I think -- and she did not want to tell us who was funding it, it was a secret. I will tell you that didn’t go, and she had to tell us who was funding it. I can not go and tell my people I voted for something and my question I said, could it be the KKK?

Now that was extreme, but that was to say that I can not explain to the community that I represent who is funding something, if I don’t know. I don’t like those secret things. The whole thing about working for the people is transparency. So why wouldn’t they tell you who they were going to bring before us? Because you’re asking me to vote for something with some blanks and question marks in it, and one of them is important about who is funding it. 

Is it the Communist Party? Is it Putin? Who funds it makes all the difference in the world to me. So, I don’t understand why you are comfortable with that.

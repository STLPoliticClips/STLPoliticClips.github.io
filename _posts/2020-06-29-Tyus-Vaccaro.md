Sharon Tyus, Alderwoman 1st ward: So when I hear that stuff. And I wanna say to you Alderman from the 23rd ward, it really pains me to hear you talk about North St. Louis like that because it is, you are racist whether you know it or not. The statements that you made are racist. 

People have been popping and sending things to my email and to my voicemail and to my texts saying, “what is he saying?” like “oh I’m scared to be up there”. That would be like me saying “oh i'm scared to be in the 23rd ward, those people live there, oh my god”. 

I can’t believe you said that and I don’t believe you know that you sound like that, but that’s what you sound like.

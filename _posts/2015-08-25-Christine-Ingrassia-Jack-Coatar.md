Christine Ingrassia, Alderwoman ward 6: There's a definition with respect to the immediate risk to health in St. Louis City, and our whereas clauses do address that. The prevalence of obesity, diabetes, asthma, and other health problems, heart problems, are associated with low income. So, I do believe that this qualifies under out definition of public health.

Jack Coatar, Alderman ward 7: Well that’s where we would respectfully disagree Alderwoman. I don’t see how changing the wage structure in the City of St Louis is an immediate health concern. I understand that higher wages can cause some impact, and I guess help people get healthier, but it doesn’t create an emergency and that’s what we’re talking about.

Ald. Ingrassia: It does because poor people are actually dying.

Ald. Coatar: Can I finish Alderwoman? Can I finish?

Ald. Ingrassia: You may.

Ald. Coatar: Thank you. We have an emergency clause in a very clear definition of emergency clause, which I believe that redistricting bill, upon further analysis, would fall under. I don’t believe this does. So, if we’re going to use emergency clauses willy nilly, they’re very clear in there for public work projects and things we want to get done in a timely manner, that we want to get done immediately so we can get these projects. This does not qualify as an emergency. 

So, to just attach an emergency clause because we want to get this done in a hurry, I think -- well, we’re already doing this too fast -- and I believe a bad bill overall -- but further rushing a bad bill to get it signed and passed into law even quicker, I think is a bad idea.

Ald. Ingrassia: Well according to Jason Purnell with Washington University, 12,000 deaths in the City of St. Louis and St. Louis combined in 2012 were attributable to poverty. So, I would again, respectfully disagree with your take on this.

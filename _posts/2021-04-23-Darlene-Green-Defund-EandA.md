Darlene Green, Comptroller: I’ll second with a comment. I would have liked for us to discuss what we intend to do but I know that's not possible. Especially with these Zooms. 

But I do intend after hearing comments to definitely move to recommend to the other members of Estimate and Apportionment to look at substantial reductions when it comes to police positions that have gone vacant for several years. That’s something I’m going to recommend. 

I’m going to recommend that we look at a 1.5 million dollar increase to Affordable Housing Trust. I think that we might be able to make that a permanent mandate after discussion. Right now the mandate is 5, it could go up, especially during this recovery period.

I think that in addition, home repair grants could be looked at. Increasing 911 funding, increasing health and human services funding. So those are just my thoughts that I will go into further discussions with the other members of the Board of Estimate and Apportionment. 

I wanted to make it clear at this meeting because I believe we only have one more meeting before we’re actually gunna move this budget over to the Board of Alderman. I think the Board of Estimate and Apportionment can make some critical adjustments prior after hearing from our community to move forward towards what we need in the budget.

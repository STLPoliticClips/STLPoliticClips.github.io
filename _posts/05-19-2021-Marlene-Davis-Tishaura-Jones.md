Marlene Davis, Alderwoman ward 19: One of the things I talk to my constituents about is having a better understanding of what it means for the word “defund police”, because they’re very confused. I’ve explained it the best I could, but I need them to hear it from you. You are the one who is leading our city, and they must have the trust from. If you don’t mind explaining a little bit..

Tishaura Jones, Mayor: Yes, thank you Alderwoman Davis. So, in this year’s budget, we moved $4 million from the police budget. There were $4 million moved from the police budget of unfilled police positions. These positions had been unfilled for years. The Police Chief himself said that they were having difficulty filling them for years. We worked with the Police Chief, as well as their budget people to identify money that was not being used in the police budget and it was from this line item “unfilled vacancies”. 

What we’re using this money to do is to transform public safety and invest in things that actually make people safe. So, as I explained before, that $4 million will go to --- $1.5 million will be allocated to the Affordable Housing Trust Fund, $1 million is gonna go to Victim Support Services, including supporting funeral expenses, medical needs, child care, mental health support, case and crisis management, as well as trauma informed support. 

That money’s really important and I’ll explain why because, a lot of time, if we can support victims at the time crime occurs, and give them support that they and their families need, often times that can divert future crime from happening.

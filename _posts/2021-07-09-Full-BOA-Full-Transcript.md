Christine Ingrassia, 6th ward Alderwoman  5:18  
Thank you Mr. President just wanted to pause for a moment before we start the meeting to send our thanks to Stephen Acree many of you have worked with him in his capacity at our CDA, which is now RISE community development. He has undertaken an impressive amount of affordable housing worth $300 million in residential development 1200 units of affordable housing in the city of St. Louis, and all over including East St. Louis and Ferguson as well. He has received awards too numerous to mention, it took up over an entire paragraph on his resolution. And rice has also undertaken neighborhood planning efforts in the Gravois Jefferson corridor, the Ferguson comprehensive plan and the width Stanley neighborhood plan in East St. Louis. He has also played an integral role in the Missouri workforce housing association, which was started in 2009. It's a statewide affordable housing professional organization and advocacy group that helped restore the Missouri low income housing tax credits here in the state of Missouri. He has also served as a mentor and helped launch the careers of many of our community development professionals here in the St. Louis region, and is a lifelong resident of the city of St. Louis has lived in Lafayette Square for nearly 40 years started out without hot water in that home. He was restoring windows in exchange for rent. It's Stephen is also an adventure traveler. And one of his things favorite things to do is to jump from high places once made an 829 foot jump from the top of the stratosphere in Las Vegas. So I just wanted to pause today to let any alderman who would like to say some words of thanks for Stephens incredible career and let him say a few words if he is interested in doing that as well.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  7:13  
Thank you all along. I'll open up for discussion. Any questions or comments? discussion? Well, I'll start all the men from the 25th.

Shane Cohn, 25th ward Alderman  7:32  
Think. Thank you, Mr. President. This is definitely a kind of bittersweet resolution. It's one of those moments where you have someone who's very active in the community who has done so many wonderful things, was taking another journey in their life. And well, we'll miss them and their previous capacity. You know, very excited about their new their new journey, their new chapter. I have to say thank you to Stephen. He has been a wonderful partner for projects and the 25th ward. I think one in particular that comes to mind, although there's several. But one in particular that comes to mind are the apartments along South spring Avenue. They were at the time I was elected 12 years ago, just I used to joke that it was a Sodom and Gomorrah of my neighborhood. It was about I think 2425 buildings that were all vacant, about 100 units at the time, right behind a high school. And just all sorts of activity as all of us know when there's a huge amount of vacancy that all sorts of illicit activity takes place on those vacant buildings. But it was an entire block, the entire 4700 block of South spring was vacant and derelict and just in really awful condition. The buildings to the north of it on the 4600 block of spring were also vacant at the time. So it was basically an entire section of my ward that just looked nightmarish. I think at the time, we also had like 2000 calls for police service and a year to those blocks just because of the, you know, numerous activities that were taking place there. But I had worked to get a grant from the Department of Economic Development of the state of Missouri and I couldn't find anyone, literally any developer that would take on this project. And I showed up at Steve's Stephens house on my hands and knees and literally begged him and rice or hcda at the time to please help me and my neighbors with this project and told him about the A few million dollars that we were getting from the DVD and talked about, you know, various other commitments that we thought we might be able to make happen. And he said, Let me think about it. But over the course of probably about three years, or maybe longer, we were able to get that project done. It was a project of love for me. But I know it was a project that he and the organization were very committed to. And it has made a world of difference in my neighborhood. And so. But again, it's just one out of many. I think at the time, we also had another nonprofit developer that had gone bankrupt, went to foreclosure, a lot of their properties went into foreclosure or H CDA kind of interceded and helped with that. But time and time again, with community planning processes, partnering with our CDC. You know, the partnership has been just a tremendous asset to dutchtown and other neighborhoods throughout the city. And Steven, your efforts, you know, championing those will forever, you know, be cherished, from, from my perspective, so I can't thank you enough. I think we've, you know, formative wonderful friendship over the years. And while I'm sad to see you leave rice, I'm very excited for you to be able to, you know, have this new chapter in your life as well.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  11:35  
Thank you, alderman alderman from the ninth.

Dan Guenther, Alderman ward 9  11:41  
Thank you, Mr. President. I just wanted to say a quick thank you as well to Stephen, I truly appreciate the leadership that you provide it for the Jefferson graboid neighborhood planning initiative. I know that was almost three years of getting neighbors together to develop a plan as to bringing about equitable development into the parts of

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  12:09  
we, we lost you all. We lost you. We can see your mouth move, but we're not getting any. Welcome back to you, alderman from the 22nd.

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  12:26  
Yes, thank you. Good morning, Mr. President, members of the board, I certainly like to say thank you to Stephen. I met Stephen back in the late 90s, when it was already CDA. And I was a brand new executive director pretty much of a local community development corporation and just enthusiasts and excited about bringing new development to the 22nd ward in the Hamilton Heights neighborhood at the time and plan for capacity building grant, because that's what we needed that organization to really get to the next level. And I remember as I was putting the application together, it was totally, it was getting close to five o'clock, and it was around three or so. And I'm making the fast copies as necessary in the copy machine jam. And I had papers in my hand and they literally flew out all over the office and I called Steve and I was like Steven, I don't know if I can make it back five o'clock. I'm struggling. I've got the papers just flew everywhere. And he said, get it done. Get here. And fortunately, I made it there on time. And we got to work the grant. And it's been a great experience. I've considered Stephen along with bar guys, man, I met her around the same time, as mentors of mine in this community development space is rich with a lot of knowledge, always willing to give free advice. And I appreciate all the service that you have done to our region, Steven, even though we did get a chance to partner in 22nd Ward, you know, for brick and mortar, but we have partnered when it came to capacity building, and you know, giving good advice to the neighborhood organizations to kind of help them out to move to the next level. So again, thank you for all your service to St. Louis, and have a happy retirement.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  14:09  
Thank you all to me. All the ones from the 17th.

Tina "Sweet T" Pihl, 17th ward Alderwoman  14:16  
Thank you President Reid and members of board. Yeah, hi, Steven. This is a wonderful to honor you. In you going to retirement. I've worked with Steven, back in about 2012 with the start of the Spanish league CDC. And I had another person on began the Spanish league CDC from scratch. And rise came in to help with some technical assistance. And the first year that I was executive director of that organization and it was phenomenal and the Spanish Lake CDC is still going on up there doing a portable housing. And now, I am fortunate enough to continue to work with rise regarding the light tech in the 17th. Board, you have created a phenomenal organization and the successor and how you've been able to have successors in this is great. And again, congratulations.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  15:26

Stephen Acree  15:41  
Mr. President, I have some work going on here in my home, I have a little bit of trouble with noise in the background. But I do want to deeply thank all of you. I'm very touched and take to heart that kind words that have been said, and I've appreciated working with all of you over the years, and what has been really a joy to me in the work that I've been able to do in the city. So thank you all so much. Thank you, Steven. And I also just want to tell you, thank you for all the work that you did with me when I was alderman six more. And I think the comments from moment from the 22nd captured a lot of it. For those of you who don't know, Steven, and I haven't got an opportunity to meet meet Stephen. You know, when it's time to get it done, Stephen can be very direct and, and help to get you over over the hump. You know, and if you're, if you're confused about something, he will, he can really begin to paint the picture for you so that so that you understand the full implications of everything. So he did a just we did all sorts of work when I came into office in the sixth ward. And, you know, I had an opportunity to be his alderman at the time. And, you know, he just, I learned a lot from Steven. I was disappointed when he took this current role, because we worked closely together before, but now I'm just so happy that you have done that, because the work that you did since getting there, it's just been phenomenal. And, you know, you Congratulations on your retirement. All along for me.

That's to take care of all the other one for me.

Annie Rice, 8th ward Alderwoman  45:20  
Thank you, Mr. President. I and 

I apologize to the alderman from the 21st for the late notice on pulling this off to the regular calendar. I just this looks like a significant bill for transparency for the Board of Aldermen. And so I thought it would be good just to hear in your words, what exactly we're changing here and how this will affect our operations and our transparency to the public. So if the Alderman from the 21st would yield or just respond either way,

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  45:44  
I will ask them, I'll see if he'll yield, but it really doesn't change anything. It's the language we take up every-- Alderman from the 21st.

John Collins-Muhammad, 21st Alderman  45:54  
Thank you, Mr. President. Alderwoman rice, this board bill does not change anything. This is an annual board bill that we do to be in compliance with state law under the Missouri Ethics Commission and legislation passed by the state legislator. So this doesn't change -- this is not change anything. This solidifies what we've already passed and solidifies our, our promises to stay in compliance with with with with federal law and regulation.

Annie Rice, 8th ward Alderwoman  46:23  
Okay, wonderful. Thank you for that. I think there was some confusion because I know we've had discussion around changing some of our ethics and reporting. So I had gotten some questions from folks about whether this didn't change anything. So I appreciate the brief discussion, alderman. Thank you,

John Collins-Muhammad, 21st Alderman  46:38  
No problem Alderwoman Rice. And I'll also tell you this Kansas City actually models their legislation after hours here in the city of St. Louis, as it relates to this conflict of interest and ethics legislation.

Thank you

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  46:54  
all the moment from the first

Sharon Tyus, 1st ward Alderwoman  46:57  
President, members of the board, I'd also just add that by us doing this we do not have to do certain ethics disclosures because we have our own. So that is also part of the ethics rule that if we do not have our own, then we have to go through a different procedure. But since we have our own, then we avoid that additional compliance through the Ethics Commission.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  47:17

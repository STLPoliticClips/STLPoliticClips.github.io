Tom Oldenburg, Alderman ward 16: I know it's certainly Vogue to make sure that you can put your thumb down around what's been called corporate welfare and an over subsidized business. But I think it's an important distinction. If you were basing your vote solely on the fact that you think Hilton is saving pennies as a result of this. It's not, it's a risk taker, a real estate developer who owns this piece.  And Hilton is simply actually getting money as a result of this. 

I can certainly want to speak because it was mentioned that the hospitality industry is on the rebound. As someone who's very close to financing, hospitality assets and hotels, that couldn't be further from the truth. In fact, hotels can even get debt at the moment right now. Because the outlook is dubious at best. 

So there needs to be a considerable amount of owner equity that's being put into any hotel facelift and hotel development right now. The hospitality industry is a large creator of jobs. And it is important that we incentivize risk takers, particularly in an industry that is incredibly hard hit.

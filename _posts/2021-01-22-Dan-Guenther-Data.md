Dan Guenther, Alderman ward 9: I know I’ve brought up in the past and I’ll continue to bring up that there’s the discussion of ‘oh well this is absolutely only going to be for use by the police department’, but there are articles from Baltimore that says -- the title of the article is ‘As Police Weigh Surveillance Programs, the Private Company at the Helm Looks to Court Private Clients’. 

The article in it says “Mr. McNutt said, in fact, that he has already $2 - 3 million off of selling this information to insurance companies. So, for us to be able to sit back and say that we’re going to trust the fact that this is going to be different then what his entire business plan was for the program, that this is going to be a different one, we don’t have that guarantee.

Christine Ingrassia, Alderwoman ward 6: I just wanted to weight in, in support of this bill. I understand a lot of the questions that are being asked, and I guess that I would be a lot more concerned, if everyone has not been at the table since the former Alderman Kennedy has been bringing these issues to the forefront. 

Alderman Kennedy moved from his position as a Ward representative, to a representative to all of us at the board. Then, I took it on. Then, the Alderman from the 21st took it on. Now the Alderwoman from the 8th has taken it on. I’m getting really confused and mixed messages today. Especially on what we think we need to just drive intor the ground in terms of stakeholder involvement and transparency -- which I completely agree with -- then what we’re allowed to brush under the carpet. 

Which issue is important? Is the Airport okay because it “has to be a rush deal”? Is surveillance not okay because of this? This is definitely something --- the surveillance bill-- that has been a long time coming, and a long line of people have been working on this.

So, to ask the Alderwoman from the 8th to stall it… I think is incredibly short sighted, doesn’t make a lot of sense, if we’re framing it in arguments that we’re trying to move forward with the rest of this legislative session.

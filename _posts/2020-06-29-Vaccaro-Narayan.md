Lewis Reed, President of the Board of Alderman: Alderman from the 23rd

Joe Vaccaro, Alderman 23rd ward: Will from the Alderman from the 24th yield for a question?

Reed: Alderman from the 24th?

Bret Narayan, Alderman 24th ward: Absolutely.

Vaccaro: So you’re an attorney right? 

Narayan: Yes sir.

Vaccaro: You have a law firm?

Narayan: Yes sir.

Vaccaro: And if you had a client, and you just did a ton of work, you spent a lot of your money doing a lot of the research, and then they say ‘gee if I wait a little extra bit, I wont have to pay him for all that work’, and they go ahead and present the case, wouldn’t you be a little bit upset? Don’t you think...

Narayan: I think ultimately what you’re describing is called a contingency agreement. Lawyers do them regularly, where you take on work with the idea that if you’re successful, you get paid on the back end. I can tell ya from talking to my colleagues. I don't personally work on contingency, it’s just not the way my firm is set up, but I can tell you from talking to many of my colleagues, you gotta be prepared to also take a beating on that money when you work on contingency. There’s no guarantees in this world and when you work on contingency, you lose, you win and you lose. It’s like playing poker.

Vaccaro: Okay, well, it just seems that we’re trying to put together something to just delay this so we don’t have to pay them for their time. I am absolutely not a Rex fan, or any of these guys. I just also know that it seems a little dishonest.

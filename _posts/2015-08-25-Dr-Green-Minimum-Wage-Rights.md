Dr. Megan Green, Alderwoman ward 15: This is not just an economic justice issue, this is also a racial justice issue, this is a women’s right issue and we need to look at it as such. Over the last 10 years, we’ve gotten to a place where we’re seeing CEO pay that is unprecedented. It is at all time highs, but our workers are suffering.

Had our wages actually kept up with productivity from the 1960s, we would be paying nearly $22 an hour right now. $22 an hour. We’re fighting over to give a $13 an hour raise over a 5 year period? To me, that’s asinine. I mean, how can we even argue against that.

We have these companies that are making profits off our most vulnerable people who have the least say in government, who have the least seat at the table and we continue to do it over and over and over and over again.

We’ve had people out in the streets here for over a year now asking for the government to be responsive to them, saying that we are done not having a seat at the table. This is one thing that we can do to help restore faith in our government. To say that we as people down in city hall are listening to you, we understand that you are suffering and we are going to do what we can in our legislative power to make that happen.

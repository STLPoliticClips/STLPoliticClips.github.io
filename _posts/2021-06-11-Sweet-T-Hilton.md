Sweet T, Alderwoman ward 17: Thank you, Mr. President, and the board. Can you hear me this time? Great. 

I'd like to rise and I am concerned with this particular abatement and sales tax exemption. The reason is that the Hilton has made over $800 million in the first quarter of this year. And so they strongly have funds to be able to do this in terms of updating the interior of this hotel. 

So I really am concerned regarding having an abatement again because Hilton has made $800 million this quarter. Thank you.

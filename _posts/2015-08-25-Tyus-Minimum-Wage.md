Sharon Tyus, Alderwoman ward 1: A lot of people now who don’t have jobs, they go work at fast food restaurants. They go to work at other places. So, you don’t necessarily get a workforce that “doesn’t know what they’re doing”. You may get a very educated workforce. 

I told the story when I came out of law school, because I had surgery, I couldn’t get a job. I would have worked any job I could have taken. I got told no because I was too educated. So, this whole assumption that the workforce you’ll get is not going to be knowing what they’re doing is just not true.

We’ve got these kids that go to school, that doesn’t mean they don’t know anything, that doesn't mean that they don’t know how to do things. Many young people have worked their way through college. 

We have an idea about young people, like we use to do about women. “Oh those women don’t really need to work, because they’ve got their husband to take care of them” and “they’re just getting a job and they’re taking a man’s job”, that’s what my mother was told when she went to work when she went to work back when I was in Grade School. She was taking a man’s job. Now we talk about young people like that. “Oh, they don’t really need those jobs”, or “they don’t really know what they’re doing”, yes they do. 

They are hard working young people. Many have gone to college, they don’t have jobs many times because --- and they have all these loans that they've had to get to go to college. I do not presume that the workforce that we will be impacting is somebody that’s untrainable or that doesn’t know anything.

7/7/21 HUDZ meeting FULL pt. 2 (add 2:30:00 to all time stamps)


Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  0:00  
I'm going to be working with Mr. Richardson, I'm sure he'll be, you know, supportive to want to work with me. I hate to stand out there like that, but I'm pretty reasonably sure he would work with me, and all of us in these distressed neighborhoods to try to court, if you will, developers that come in our wards and on our bullet bars to do development, and so it's 4.3 million hours on average, along that particular stretch, and then you have on grand, which is point five miles, you basically have if I did my math, right, that basically like $6 million per mile, you know, to do some development on that particular stretch. And then you have West florissant, which is 1.5 miles, which is $3.3 million, basically, for that particular stretch per mile. And then you have Natural Bridge, which is 1.8 miles, which is 2.7 8 million for and so I don't if these numbers didn't necessarily are not necessarily arbitrary, but they're kind of like the prime the pump numbers, I really wanted to have $40 million along MLK, but I thought, you know, we better start slow, because we may not be able to spend the money. And so that's why we looked at those particular corridors that are very important to the African American community that were once thriving commercial districts. And so that's why we can't get close. And that was me. So that's why I'm responding to you with that. I take full responsibility and credit for that with the support of my colleagues, because it ain't all about me, let me be clear, I don't want to sound arrogant.

Shane Cohn, 25th ward Alderman  1:37  
I thanks for the clarification. Mr. Chair, I just I you know, my concern is that, you know, we appropriate these monies, and then Unfortunately, due to either a lack of planning or a lack of support that or time that we lose access to those funds, and I would show

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  1:58  
what well, and that's a great point. That was I remember the mayor when she was running, what was her comment, she said, some are saying was not a poor city, were a stingy city or something like that. I remember being stingy or something. And when it comes to development, especially when it comes to our social economic press, they but we've been we've been too stingy, we've gotten caught up in this is the way we do it. And it's the matrix we've been using for 20 or 30 years. And we got to move past that. I'm of the mindset that if you need to give 35% of gap financing in order to make this deal work, it's worth it. It's worth it at the end the day and we want to support nonprofits, as well as for profit organizations.

Shane Cohn, 25th ward Alderman  2:43  
So, um, the other thing that, and again, you know, I I support, I believe most of the items that are outlined on here, would probably actually support giving more money to some of them, which so to I've got three amendments that I'd like to propose. One would be adding more money into the direct

Dwinderlin Evans, Alderwoman ward 4  3:08  
Can you speak louder. 

Shane Cohn, 25th ward Alderman  3:09  
I'm speaking as loud as I can. alderwoman. Evans, I apologize. I don't know if it's, I'm practically yelling into my computer as it is, because I know that we are having issues with that on transportation.

Dwinderlin Evans, Alderwoman ward 4  3:21  
Okay, I'm sorry, I always have a problem hearing you. I hear everyone else. I don't know if it's my computer, or yours. I don't know.

Shane Cohn, 25th ward Alderman  3:30  
I use my computer throughout the day. And I, I don't really have an issue with it. But I am talking as loud as I can without literally shouting at my computer at the moment. So I just lost my train of thought, though, but I want to say that like, oh, the amendments? Yes, the amendments. The first one is, you know, to restore the direct cash assistance to our citizens that are in need, because the state has stopped the supplemental unemployment. The other one is addressing the administrative costs. I know, you know, part of that was removed from the the budget here, but when you look at and, you know, Chairman, you're familiar with this with the Prop S funds, we get roughly, you know, $900,000, on average in that account, and we spend, you know, I think it's somewhere between 50 and $75,000. For the, you know, just staff for that particular program, and that's not that's like $1 million, we're talking about $150 million here. And, you know, we're they're going to need some contingency funds for, you know, administrative costs that are going to come up over the course of time with with administering these federal these federal programs and the various especially since we've increased the number of programs that we're now providing with This committee substitute, you know, I think we need to restore those funds. And then lastly, although there are several more that I would like to offer, and we'll work with our colleagues to do so in the next phase of funding. You know, I think that I've been having conversations with the board of elections for the last year, year and a half now on upgrading their infrastructure to be more agile and emergency situations, and then a pandemic. And actually moving over to the anywhere voting process that St. Louis County has already adopted, they have already gotten quotes for services and things of that nature, and estimate that the cost for the hardware in order to do that implement that is in the neighborhood of about two to two and a half million dollars. And then the additional costs for training and implementation, as you know, around a million and a half. So I've got an amendment for a $5 million allocation over to the board of elections, I think we all kind of experience this on a regular basis where people get turned away from polling places, because they've moved or because they've lost their home or because they lost a job and had to move in with family members. And then in addition to that, just to be more agile with the kind of supersites that we set up for pulling with the stadium and library systems and whatnot during the pandemic, or the height of the pandemic, you know, that this provides some flexibility for our partners and the board of elections to be able to do their jobs and serve the citizens and voters of our city. So, you know, I, I'd like to offer that amendment when it comes time for it as well. Great, thank you all to my coaches.

Jack Coatar, 7th ward alderman  6:52  
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee and President Reed for work on this and, frankly, to all the mayor staff and the members of the stimulus advisory committee that worked hard on, you know, a number of the proposals that ultimately are included in this in this committee substitute. I'm planning on supporting this and a number of the amendments. You know, I think, you know, trying to drive some development to some of our hardest hit parts of the city and our phone, our economic corridors, there is a great addition. 

I also, and despite what some of my colleagues are saying I fully support, and was one that suggested moving the $5 million for towards police overtime. I mean, that's roughly the amount that was cut this year's budget, you know, looking at previous budget years past, you spent around $16 million per year on overtime. And this year, we've only budgeted 11, which, you know, we talk about budgets being living documents, and that's fine, I think we should be honest about what we're budgeting. And, frankly, with the shortage of police officers and the rise in violent crime that we're seeing, I think it's important to make sure that our police department has adequate resources to police the streets. I, the President himself, not of the board, but of the country echoed this just recently, about two weeks ago, where he said, use these rescue plan dollars for police overtime and police pay. And in fact, the Treasury Department put out additional guidance on that very line item, which which authorizes using these rescue plan funds for overtime.

Maybe our colleagues from the 15th hasn't seen that updated guidance, but she's certainly spending a lot of time spreading misinformation online about it. So I hope that will stay in the bill. I see we just recently received some additional information from the mayor's office, you know, five minutes before this hearing about her plan. I guess for these direct payments to attend dividuals. I wasn't able to attend that first hearing but but found that the answers of her staff totally unsatisfactory as to these one time payments and the criteria for those. I see we now have a few more details. But I don't know that I'm comfortable proceeding with that, especially in light of you know, we've got federal funds that are being given out through direct allocations on his state unemployment benefits that I know are have been cut some but are still being given out. 

I would support in a lottery type programs to encourage vaccinations and things. But I don't know that I'm going to be supportive of just direct cash payments when we have so many other, you know, critical city needs. So I'm looking forward to the amendments and discussing those and getting this passed today. And a healthy debate, I guess on the floor. I don't know if we're gonna do that Friday or next week. And thanks, everybody for working on this.

Dwinderlin Evans, Alderwoman ward 4  9:46  
Okay, Ottawa fanboy. Thank you, Mr. Chair. And thank you, President Reid and Mayor Jones for working on this and I'm happy to say That we had a majority of representatives from the Board of Aldermen that put their input and let people know what they felt. I was happy also that the chair the board HUDZ ensured that the public was heard loud and clear. So I think we covered our obstacles and we didn't ignore anyone. And so I, I'm going to support this bill for us to move on to the next page. And I need people to understand our city is in such a crisis, it has such high needs. And so we're not going to get it all right the first time, but we are willing to come back to look at other things that we need to address. So thank you.

John Collins-Muhammad, 21st Ward Alderman  10:46  
Thank you, alderman Mohamad. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I don't have much to add, I want to thank the President for working on this vital piece of legislation and being inclusive to all of our needs, wants and desires, especially needs in the community. And I thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your leadership on is very daunting and hard task as well. Thank you both. I support this bill, in its totality. Right, like you are the woman more?

Sarah Wood-Martin, 11th ward Alderwoman  11:21  
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I, you know, want to thank everyone for their time. I know everyone's worked hard. I know everyone has our most people have given their input. 

I'm not to beat a dead horse. But 

We can't sit here and pretend like we couldn't take action on some on the money that was coming or take public input. Until we got the mayor's recommendations. It's been repeated over and over again, that we're our own body. And that did not preclude us from having any hearings and not changing hearing dates at the last minute either. We could have had set hearings with public input. We could have collected data ourselves. I don't I kind of repeat what alderman Cohen said I like a lot of what is in this bill, I support most of it. I think a lot of it is well thought out. But when we have 50% of the bill of where we're not putting homeless encampments, and then some random development ideas with no data. I know that a lot of folks probably having visited South Broadway in the 11th ward, I didn't particularly feel like asking for word specific line items. But this is just kind of just throwing stuff at the wall at the last minute in a lot of ways.  50% of the bill being where we're not putting homeless encampments really does nothing to help us. The reality is and no one wants to say this is that no one wants homeless encampments in their ward. No one wants them or most people don't I shouldn't speak for the entire board. But their constituents don't want them. Whether it's a park or whether it's, you know, by their house, or under the interstate. 

Today, I saw that square downtown once a homeless encampment moved. There was a lot of criticism for folks who downtown folks who wanted a residence and who wanted that homeless encampment moved downtown. And now it's suddenly okay to move the encampment and everyone's all over the place on the unhoused issue. We have a crisis, the city is left dealing with this crisis because many of the advocates that come down and talk to us or make recommendations, or go after us on social media. A lot of advocates don't live in this city. And I don't know if they're really going to their local municipality to talk about these issues and see how they're spending their money that they're getting. I understand the city is getting a lot more than a lot of our area municipalities in St. Louis County. But we are left with that burden. And instead of having something as well thought out, we're just saying, oh, not my ward. And I just don't really think that's a responsible approach with the amount of money we're getting.

 Um, the other issue I have is the police overtime. I think we all want some sort of police reform. But what we're doing is not working. And we have an issue in every department be the police or forestry, where we just use overtime pay to pad low pay. And there that is one thing I think that every branch of this city could get on board with is we have to figure out a way to incentivize folks to stay or to be hired and that game where we're playing where you can just work overtime. It's just not it's not working. We're not hiring more people in any department. We have so many open positions. And again, this is something that we really need to sit down and figure out. I'd be okay if some of this money ensured that 911 calls were being answered. But I don't see that happening either. So maybe what I'm saying isn't particularly popular with everyone. But I just want to share that. And I look forward to further discussion in the amendments. Thank you.

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  15:11  
Thank you. Alderman Narayan. 

Bret Narayan, 24th ward Alderman  15:16  
Thank you, Chairman Boyd, members of the committee. So just a couple of questions here real quick. So the the website that we put up on the feedback from that, did that come to us as part of the written testimony? Or did we not see the individual feedback that we got from the website? I

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  15:38  
think it may have come as part of them. I'm sorry, Mr. Chairman. I believe it may have come as part of the some of the written testimony, but you know, this site is still up. So we still get stuff in. So what we'll do is make sure that anything that has come in there, that everybody has a comprehensive list of whatever's come in.

Bret Narayan, 24th ward Alderman  16:04  
Okay. And then, as far as the infrastructure that we see there, you know, I don't have a problem. I think the whole city dates, we need a lot of help with infrastructure. So how did we determine which which corridors were selected for this for these infrastructure spending?

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  16:31  
Well, I can tell you that, again, that was one of my initiatives, I was passionate about development and passionate about home repair. And so that's why I kept saying I've My plan was to at least 15 million dollars in home repair for these quarters came about because these were prominent commercial districts in North St. Louis over the years, and it's our time, it is our time to get our fair share, and to do redevelopment, at a speed unheard of, we want to create opportunities where people know, this is the spot we want to create, you know, like, like Central West End was reborn, you know, 30 years ago, we want to recreate the source for se when they did Manchester, and that particular neighborhood. So that's how those neighborhoods came about.

Bret Narayan, 24th ward Alderman  17:20  
So so let me rephrase my question, then. Because I'm certainly not saying that we shouldn't do that. Why were other corridors not included, I guess, in the infrastructure?

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  17:35  
Yeah. That question? Well, again, I want to make sure that this process was as inclusive as possible. And that's why I directed the clerk to ensure that he sends an email out to all my colleagues, all of us to provide input not just members of the hoods committee, but all members. And so it was up to each and every one of the alder people that represents their constituency to offer up some recommendations. But guess what the good part about this is, we're not done yet. I'm hoping that we can continue to my commitment is that we continue to work on this during the summer session, I always tell people I work 24 seven, we may be on summer break, but my phone still rings, I still get emails every day. So I'm willing to have meetings, especially with my colleagues on something as important as this.

Bret Narayan, 24th ward Alderman  18:25  
Absolutely. No, I just, I guess, I wish that we would, rather than doing it by Ward look at it as a more holistic, you know, or north side, South Side, even look at distressed areas, you know, and I and, and invest into those distressed areas. I agree with 100% of what you're saying. I I just think that there's more skill to do, basically.

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  18:51  
And you're absolutely right. But But let me point this out, because this, this brings up a really good point, you know, the city spent probably a half a million dollars doing the equitable Economic Development Study. And they wanted to create this framework of where do we go now. And so this actually fits within that model that they came up with. So we've already gotten a head start, we already pretty much done most of the data. We know where we need to go. We know what we need to do. But we don't know how to do it. And that's what request for proposals are for. So we're priming the pump with these veins of ours and expectations. We get developers like Steve Smith, who was doing the boundary, the bills we heard today, from all woman feel to give us some options, and that we as a community pick the best option.

Bret Narayan, 24th ward Alderman  19:38  
So we haven't determined yet if if these funds would be grants or revolving loans or, or exactly the mechanism, the funding mechanism itself.

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  19:51  
Yeah, we have not, that's the administration and that's why I'm telling you, I'm very supportive of the mayor when it comes to development and these socially, economically distressed neighborhoods, and I'm confident that the new Executive Director of St. Louis Development Corporation is going to come up with a policy that works. That makes sense. That's not part of how we've always done it. And so it again, I don't like to over legislative and policy and in board bills, you know, we need to leave it open. It's just great for bills of frameworks, but for us, the govern ourselves, and it's up to the administration to do the right thing. Sure, sure. And then.

Bret Narayan, 24th ward Alderman  20:31  
So in, in theory here, just just so I'm on the same page as you here. So in theory here, we would get these funds and the administration and sldc would decide whether or whether these were going to be grants, whether they were going to be some sort of revolving loan fund. And we'd start with these four corridors, at least under or built to, and we're going to get another bite at the apple, certainly. But, but we would create that framework, basically, for board bill to

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  21:06  
exact and then my prediction is, by the time we come back in September, you know, Gravois, maybe added Cherokee maybe. I mean, there are other good Cherokee, we already know, it's kind of on fire. You know, we're being redeveloped. And so, if we missed it, we missed an opportunity this time, there's still hope. There are a lot more opportunities forthcoming.

Bret Narayan, 24th ward Alderman  21:33  
Great, no. And, you know, I, I'm looking forward to working with you on on development on on the north side and south side, you know, central quarter of the whole, the whole city, you know, we have infrastructure needs, we have roads that need repaved, we got bridges that need to be rebuilt all over the city. So I'm certainly a fan of working with you on that. to shift gears a little bit. So, section 17. 

So there's two sections 17. So the first section 17, which is the opt out clause, for the intentional encampments. So, yeah, this is more of a question than a than a statement. I guess I was I was looking at the potential of doing this back when we had the the air quality control debate. I was looking at the the potential of allowing certain areas to opt out. And I was, I was told at the time that legislation that did that would be unconstitutional. Is there something different here? That that makes it constitutional? I mean, I just don't know. I'm asking, Well,

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  22:51  
you know, this is kind of like liquor moratorium, I guess we'd have to say liquor moratorium to unconstitutional. We this is I look at this as a zoning, you know, issue, kind of sorta, although it didn't, you know, it's not specific to zoning. But I look at it from that point. And I'm not a lawyer. I always tell people, you know, I practice it. But you know, it's free services. But I've never tried in court, but I win more cases than I lose on the street. I'm not sure. That's a good question. 

Bret Narayan, 24th ward Alderman  23:23  
So then, then the, the only I guess the

only other thing that I have, so I do have some concerns there. But hopefully we can we can address those either either on the floor or, you know, in the courts or wherever all that would would would get addressed. And then for the second section 17. I have a I do have an amendment there that I can. I know that you don't want to get into the amendments right now. Just wanted to come back. There was one. Yeah. So I do have an amendment there. Just wanted to bring that to your attention. And that is all I have for now. Thank you so much.

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  24:03  
Thank you, Ottoman kotar. Vice Chairman. Okay, why don't we know him? Yes, Chairman. Sorry. Can you give me three minutes? Sure. It's all at all on the heavens.

Jack Coatar, 7th ward alderman  24:20  
All right. All the open evidence, which I was getting a snack alderwoman Evans, you're up.

Dwinderlin Evans, Alderwoman ward 4  24:26  
Okay. All righty. Thank you, Mr. co chair and Mr. Chair and Mr. And the President and members of the committee. I hate he stepped away because one of the questions that I want, but you may have the answer. What was the amount designated for the MLK corridor? attorney Mr. Shepherd on that. I'm sorry.

Tom Shepard, Chief of Staff PBOA  24:57  
Say that again? Sure. You're there's a 20 million and exhibit one, there's $20 million appropriated for that. it's little wonder five miles, the five mile stretch of that Martin Luther King.

Dwinderlin Evans, Alderwoman ward 4  25:19  
Okay. And I guess as soon as we get this bill passed, we'll be able to access those funds, right?

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  25:28  
Yes. Yep.

Dwinderlin Evans, Alderwoman ward 4  25:31  
Yes. Okay. Yes. Okay. So that was it. I just wanted to know what was designated. Oh, what are the other four core doors that were mentioned. Besides the MLK. There's a

Tom Shepard, Chief of Staff PBOA  25:47  
North grand Boulevard, core, North West fluorescent core door and a Natural Bridge core door I can give you there's actually an amendment in the drive that gives the boundaries but I can give them to you. Now, so um, it would be MLK from the city limits of wellston or sango. City limit to Jefferson Avenue is the stretch of Martin Luther King. But North grand between cottage in Heber, West Florida sent between Acme and union. What was that? Between Acme and union? And for natural bridge between kingshighway and then dinner.

Dwinderlin Evans, Alderwoman ward 4  26:50  
Thank you very much. I have no further questions.

Jack Coatar, 7th ward alderman  26:59  
All right. I think that concludes questions to members of the committee. Chairman. Are you back? I am back. Okay. I'll see any hands up? Anybody else? 

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  27:10  
Let's move right along. So let's move into a minutes. I'm gonna go back to the President. And then we can go into minutes after that, Mr. President, what's your wish

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  27:22  
I'm good to move into amendments. I know people have been here for a while we can't afford to lose. So I'm ready to go. 

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  27:33  
Okay, so there are amendments in the Google Drive. But they don't show a sponsor. amendment number one is being offered by all the men of the seventh. Okay, so you're recognized.

Jack Coatar, 7th ward alderman  27:54  
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee amendment number one's pretty simple, it will simply add it to the board bill, page 27, line 16, after line 27 after the words union Boulevard to the point of beginning and then 

It will insert the boundary of the seventh ward in the boundaries of the 10th ward. You know, this basically adding to the neighborhoods, they're the boards that are I guess, unwilling to host homeless encampments sponsored by the city. In the Seventh Ward, I can tell you we have many encampments as it is both in downtown parks and under many of the interstates overpasses in the seventh ward. And these are a constant source of frustration and issues for law enforcement and for constituents and businesses in the seventh ward. It's something that I'm not going to get behind. And I don't think my constituents will, and the alder from the 10 felt the same way. So this amendment just seeks to add those two boundaries into the sort of exclusion areas. 

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  29:06  
Okay, let's see if we have any questions all woman Davis. Any questions about member number one?

Sarah Wood-Martin, 11th ward Alderwoman  29:12  
Mr. Chairman, I have no questions. I'll make a quick statement. For a lot of people who don't know some of us have a number of opportunities for transitional housing, overnight housing, permanent housing, and have had it for years and our wards. And so we're doing our fair share, but we will not have intentional encampments, because people deserve decent quality opportunities to live. And that's what we should focus on. Thank you.

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  29:49  
All right, thank you. Next up is automate calm.

Shane Cohn, 25th ward Alderman  29:56  
These are questions and comments about the amendment correct amendment. We're on amendment number one. Yeah, um, you know, I share my frustration, or the frustration of many of my colleagues, I, you know, struggle with the unhoused fairly regularly. And, you know, one to take the most compassionate approach to helping those who are in that situation in life. And also, you know, but also recognizing that my ward in particular, because of the affordability, you know, I have organizations like St. Patrick's center, and St. Peter and Paul and Salvation Army, and, you know, a slew of other nonprofits that already own housing stock in my ward and provide either I mean, you can call it intentional housing, but you know, temporary housing or sheltered housing for their various nonprofit organizations. And, you know, I, I've been through this process already, a little bit with the mayor's office, because I did get an email several weeks ago, maybe about, actually about two months ago, around the possibility of an intentional encampment being in the neighborhood. But I, frankly, I thought the area that they were planning it in might have been a potential candidate, but they weren't even looking at that area. And so I was a little bit surprised by the area that they were looking at. And, you know, I was actually told that they're no longer looking at that as a prospect because of the conditions of the property. So, you know, that being said, I really kind of also have to take umbrage that so many of my colleagues have just automatically signed up, you know, opting out of this, because I think we all have certain areas in our Ward that might be appropriate. You know, irrespective of how we feel about, you know, the particular issue, our wards are pretty large. And, you know, generally speaking, there's, there's likely a place within them that something like this could potentially be successful. You know, but I know we all kind of struggle with some of the same challenges when it comes to these types of activities and, and whatnot. But, you know, 

I do think that with the intentional housing, it does provide some wraparound services, they are trying to be more thoughtful and how that's done. I think all of us should have questions around just that, you know, what are those wraparound services? How are they going to be provided and also how it's going to be sustainable moving forward, because it's nice to have the, you know, one time drop in the bucket cash to set these things up, but how are we going to continue to sustain them in the future. But I think it's a little disingenuous on the part of our board to just unilaterally say, well, we don't want these in our neighborhoods. You know, I think that we should still take a thoughtful approach to how we're handling our unhoused brothers and sisters, you know, and how we might be able to give them a leg up. You know, I, again, I share many of the frustrations of my colleagues, but I do think that it's a little disingenuous to just completely opt out. 

And so I believe that the amendment if I understand my colleague from the seventh Ward correctly, is expanding the number of words that are opting out in the committee substitute, and you know, I would have to vote against that. Okay, thank you very much. I'm a fanboy.

Dwinderlin Evans, Alderwoman ward 4  33:55  
Okay, uh, yes. Is the chair, I think people are kind of taking this to another level that it shouldn't be. And I don't think it's where people don't want the unhoused in their community because, contrary to what the former people have, other people have said, North St. Louis has tons of unhoused in their communities. That's how our brick homes are being set on fire. That's how drug addicts are living in our in these properties. And so we have those people in our communities. It's not that it's to the point that we don't want them in a tent on the ground, in the in the air or whatever. If they're going to be let's do it. Right. Let's do it where their house where alderman Shane is saying he has said, Patrick said that they have spaces for those people, they're in rooms, Salvation Army, they have spaces for those people. And so all we're saying is We don't want to get set up with people out there washing up and doing stuff in the public because they have dignity, that's dignity on them that we're not looking at taking care of them in a dignified manner. And so mental illness is a big issue. And so people need to say what it is, as the big elephant in the room. A lot of this is mental illness. And so we need to address the mental illness issues. But we're not saying we don't want the homeless in our communities, because we have them in our community. But we don't want them in tents on the ground is out a woman Davis said they need to have some kind of dignity about themselves. And we need to make sure that we're doing that. So it's not that we say, and we don't want to deal with the homeless, because we deal with them on a regular basis. But we want to make sure that they're treated fairly and can I think what's going on downtown is undignified for those people, and they shouldn't be living like that living on the bridge is living in an in a park. And now it's real hard, and the winners real call. And that's not how they should be living. And so I feel that we need to have a plan and we need to give a Sam page, and they need to work with us as a city because contrary to what people believe, the county is dumping people in our city. And so they need to take some dollars and come to the table. And let us fix this permanently in regards to the homeless people, or unhoused, or whatever you call them. But I call them people that need help. And we need to come up with a plan to say how we're gonna do that. And it shouldn't be a plan, putting people in a port with a tent, and they have no running water, they have no toilets, they have no way to clean itself up or live a decent life. So that's where I'm at, you know, I think we need to look at this and we can come after we vote this out, we can come back to the table, bring the city and county together and look at how we can improve this process and treat people with dignity. Thank you.

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  37:19  
Thank you, alderman Muhammad. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm gonna support this amendment. 

John Collins-Muhammad, 21st Ward Alderman  37:34  
If we're talking about permanent residents who housing for for homeless or put on house, and we're on to something where we're talking about doing right now is literally putting them in vacant school locks and, and other vacant parcels and calling it and calling it a cap. The problem I have with that is in my ward already got poor people. I got poor people, I got poverty, you're going to invite more poverty into my neighborhood. And I'm trying to change that culture. I'm trying to change that narrative. That's the issue for me. We're not talking about giving them real wraparound services, either. We're not talking about 24 hour care, we're not talking about security. We're not talking about mental health. We're not talking about real resources, tangible resources, is going to help them and lift them out from the current condition theory. Now anybody that knows me knows I care about the homeless operator homeless shelter in my ward for 180 days at a church we know City Health got by with literally got by with the president Board of Aldermen giving $100 every other week, just to make sure that we can buy toilet paper and food for the homeless people that we were serving. And we served right around 213 homeless families when we did operate this homeless shelter so I care about the homeless. So to say that is disingenuous. That's a slap in my face. I'm not going to accept that. I'm not going to accept that whatsoever. You got me messed up for real. But the only schools and in the city of St. Louis that's vacant that has not been turned into apartment complexes yet. We have 2020 schools now with the with the with the few more schools that are slated to close it'd be up to 2015 are in are in North St. Louis. So you're talking about putting homeless people only in North St. Louis. I feel for my colleague and a seven four because his community is saturated by homeless people. I feel for it. I don't want the same thing in my neighborhood. I hope my neighborhoods have grown. I want to develop. We definitely have to give people the help they need. But this ain't the way and it's not going down in my work. That's all I have, Mr. Chairman. Thank you. Thank you. All the woman Martin.

Sarah Wood-Martin, 11th ward Alderwoman  39:53  
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I know I talked about this. But the issue is is that we have a lot of people who just Do not want to be housed. And that is the problem. And it goes beyond just finding someone a place to live. I completely understand my constituents. A majority of them, I'm going to venture to guess do not want homeless encampments either. But when we divide this up by Ward, we're essentially doing what we're doing as a region and just pushing people all over the place rather than finding solutions. I have a lot of unhoused folks in my ward. We've had encampments. And this is not just a North Side problem, I welcome anyone to come down and take a look around my ward. And it's an it's not hard to miss in the parks, or just out on the street. So I really think this is something again, we can't just push around for more reward. We really, as a collective body need to work with the experts in this matter, those providing services, and at least try to propose some solutions.

Bret Narayan, 24th ward Alderman  41:06  
Thank you. Thank you. Follow them. No, Ryan. Thank you, Chairman. So you know, I agree with with both alderwoman Boyd and alderwoman Martin on this. You know, I think that what everyone is pushing for in this when we come to the unhoused population is to get roofs overheads, especially before winter comes I know that the county does not seem to be doing their fair share of the, of putting allocating resources to this issue. I agree with her when she says you know, sometimes people don't believe it. But the county, you know, we'll just let homeless folks out. In the city, you know, we we've seen that here in the 24th. Ward, we border the county. And on occasion, you can see that sort of thing. But 

I think that breaking this down Ward by Ward, is a mistake. We've seen that in the various various things that we've done throughout the city that need to be a comprehensive program. When we break down Ward by Ward it, it falls apart on us we we end up pushing the problem into each other's wards as all and there's not a centralized solution for easier things like traffic calming. When, when I'm looking at these intentional encampments, I'm thinking about things like the the veterans community project that we all just looked at, and many of us supported, if we can look at projects like that, and locate them in places that have access to, to jobs, access to places to, to buy food, access to, to hospitals, you know, things of that nature, and public transit, you know, all of that we can actually help people get back up on their feet, there are people of course, who are not ready or do not want to be housed at the moment. And you know, some of them, it's going to be much harder to to get to get to the bottom of of how to solve that problem. But I think that just simply opting out wholesale is it's gonna make it harder to find a solution that works here.

 Additionally, like I brought up previously, I'm just not sure how it's constitutional when I've been told in the past that allowing Ward's to opt out of things as is is unconstitutional. So on on this amendment, I'm just going to present I'm not going to try and get in the way of it because ultimately, this bill needs to get pushed forward. And I'm not trying to hold anything up. But I certainly want to want to take a harder look at whether or not this is something that is legal.

Dwinderlin Evans, Alderwoman ward 4  44:19  
Thank you. You're welcome. Evans. Yes, thank you, Mr. Chair. I have several facilities in my ward. they cater to that on house. I don't know if you have heard of Pastor Mike but he has several places where he like I said cater to the unhoused. When you have facilities that cater to the on house, you should not be able to identify Find them as being on house, you shouldn't be able to identify them from the house. If we're going to do this thing, right, we need to have facilities where they're treated with dignity, they have a place that they can put over their heads, they get the resources that they need. And it should not. The ideas of the tents, just puts me in mind of war time, I put it that way. And I would not feel good having to live in a tent, as many vacant buildings and vacant lots that we have, there should not be a problem with having housing for the, the for the homeless, or the unhoused. And I just I hope this bill will help take care of that problem. That's all I have to say.

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  46:16  
Okay, um, so I think what I'm hearing is there's probably half the ball. That's not interesting to have been intentional on campus and their award. And the majority of them seems to be in North St. Louis. I disagree. That is disingenuous plus to keep it real. Because the alderman we know what's going on in our neighborhoods, we even know like all the woman have been said, we know who are helping people in the unhoused community in our neighborhoods. A lot of the unhoused people in my community, they're from this community. And like all one boy said, they sleep in baking buildings, they end up burning down because they're trying to stay warm, they have real mental health issues. And we're not getting to the root of the problem by putting them in a camp. As someone who has slept many days in a tent, is not a lot of fun. It's not something I will choose. But if you mentally Do you know mine, because that's what you do. I hear what the Alma from the 24th is saying. I'm questioning whether this is a good idea period. 

Maybe there should be an amendment that just zeroes it out. Because this was not well thought out. If it was, then the alderman would have been involved. I mean, if this was a board bill right now that just dealt with it intentionally encampments, I think the administration would say, Hmm, maybe we go back to the drawing board, because there's a lot of pushback from the Board of Alder. But what I feel like in this board bill and these recommendations by the Advisory Committee, they're just going to give us what they want you because it's a great idea that somebody came up with, I'm not sure you know, what the methodology was they came up with, I'm not sure what data they analyze. I know for a fact, if people from the west side, you tell them that there's nice and encampment over on the south side, they probably not gonna stay there, because they don't know that community. They know where they are. And we do have enough of that we have so many issues in North St. Louis, that given us an intentional encampment is just not right on so many levels it's not right. If you want to prove a point to me, put it in the 8th ward, start one in the 15th ward or start one in the 17th ward to 74 start one in the 13th ward, start one in the 12th ward. If you want to impress me with this great idea. Start there. You know why? Because those are socially economically thriving communities.

 Show me what it looks like in making a mixed income community if you want to do but it's not going to benefit the majority of the people that live here. Some of the Ottoman already said, I just people in our neighborhoods, they're not going to watch it. And if it happens, I wonder why we didn't fight like hell to make sure that it doesn't happen in our community. Maybe the right thing to do is to back up, call a timeout. Zero this out of the board bill and work collaboratively the Board of Aldermen and administration on how we really make a good fix. I'm going back to my colleague from the 27th I couldn't have said no better because you took my thunder. Where is the county on this issue we heard during the marriage All crime is a regional issue. Oh, homelessness arena. We're all those fancy trendy terms. Let's put it to action. Where is that the page on this? Where do St. Louis county governments stand on this issue? I've heard for years I've been here 18 years. I've heard I can't prove it because I didn't see the police car. St. Charles dropping them off down on the Cleveland St. Louis County dropping them off downtown. other counties. We are, I don't want to say this maliciously. But in the comfort of their own house, they literally just don't people don't bodies in our community. You know why? Because we care. Because we care. And they know the city is going to do something because they're going to do much of nothing. And if I'm wrong,

so many ways, St. Louis County, Franklin County, Jefferson County, St. George's county make me wrong. Make me eat my words? Well, there's a lot of land in an unincorporated St. Louis County, why can't if you want to do it, build a whole new facility with all the wraparound service and all the social workers and everybody in the doc was in there and put a big green space for him to sit in a tent live in a tent if they want to. So they can sleep in that tent. Just like you imagine that they sleep on the school baking school well, and it's so suddenly, they're not going to sleep on asphalt.

That would be horrible, putting tents up on asphalt. So if you want to do this, let's do it. Right?

There is a message in the fact that so many oldermen are saying not in my backyard. Why? There's a reason quit trying to make us do stuff. So I'm not gonna call you out, but you know who you are. Stop trying to make us do stuff. sit down and talk to us listen to us. Let's collectively do this. This my way or the highway is not going to work. It's not going to work for this administration. It will be the demise, I promise you. We better get it together who said it I forget somebody said it was all the woman Martin tonight. But we need to get this together. And we need to do it right. And we don't have to fight about it. Because every one of us I truly believe care about the unhoused population. Every one of us, every one of us that says not in my backyard, it does not mean that we don't care. It means Enough is enough. And let's do something better than this. We're not doing anything when it countless but enabling people. If they have a mental problem, let's deal with that. Quit talking about we got to get to the root of a problem. And we're not getting to the root of the problem. Putting a bandaid on solutions is not going to work. That's just triage. We need surgery. We need to do the skillfully that it works with everybody. Not just some. So I'm in fully support. But as the chairman of this committee, I will also accept an amendment to zero it out. So that we can back up and do a time out. So I'm gonna vote for this. But by the time we come back around to the last amendment, if somebody want to make an amendment, and we can all agree, I am well, I will be your biggest cheerleader. Because I don't want to get sued. I want to do it right. Um, I'm gonna say this for the next two years. I'm not getting no training trains with no back. I'm going to do what I think is right for the community that I represent, period that. With that said, Mr. President, and then we're gonna go for a vote. In comments. Chairman, I will allow for the amendment. Can I briefly close? Wait a minute, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Oh, we own the precedent. You're

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  54:27  
sorry. Yeah. I'm lasting seniority on these. Sorry. That's right, mess you up. Now, Mr. Chairman, I think you summed it up quite well. I mean, I there's nothing else that can be added to that. So I'm supporting this amendment. I think it's good amendment and I think people should have the ability to represent the wards that they represent. I don't think that this is speaking as a person who was homeless, not for a week. I'm on today but for multiple for an extended amount of time well over a year and a half, almost two years. So I know this personally, and I'm having people sleep on the ground. having them do it in a, in a condensed area is not helping them. I don't know how many of you have slept in encampments, but I have and some of the things that go on in those encampments that a lot of people could could deal with. Because when you step out of your little enclosure in the morning, someone may have dedicated right there at your door. That's the kind of stuff and when you sit down to eat whatever scraps whatever you were able to put together. Guess what sitting right next to you that like it's that kind of things within these encampments that are just inhumane. And, Mr. Chairman, one of the things you raised was right on point you said, whether you're gonna do it on blacktop, that's exactly what those school parking lots are blacktop. And this is not a humane approach. We can take that same those same funds, and put them into enclosures and programs and services that would provide more support for the homeless. But thank you, Mr. Chairman. Like I said, You summed it up. Okay. Before it's a meme number one sponsored by autoencoder. I'll make a motion on that.

Jack Coatar, 7th ward alderman  56:36  
Move that we adopt amendment number one to board bill to committee substitute.

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  56:41  
Second second, it's been moved the second amount of work please call the roll.

Ryan, all 2424. You recognize them amendment number two.

Bret Narayan, 24th ward Alderman  57:54  
Thank you, Chairman, members of the committee. This is a pretty straightforward change to Section 17. And that's going to be the section Excuse me. Second, section 17 on your board bill, which is the conflicts of interest section. So beginning on page 27, line 17, we would strike through to prevent the appearance that confidential information authority or influence on any governmental decision could have been gained through involvement in the stimulus advisory board. organizations who had employees or board members as representatives on the mayor's stimulus advisory board will not be allowed to contract for any of the services for which funding is appropriated in this ordinance. And we would replace that with to ensure the selection of providers based on merit. All providers seeking contracts with the city of St. Louis must engage in a competitive bid process in accordance with ordinance 64102. The rules and procedures for professional services agreement established by the Board of Public Service and two CFR 200 uniform administrative requirements, cost principles and audit requirements for federal awards. Additionally, all reciprocally all recipients of ARPA funds must affirm their compliance to a conflict of interest form subject to verification by the comptroller. So under the existing line, and this is a friendly amendment here. I spoke to President read prior to the meeting here. The under the existing language, there would be some issues where organizations like the United Way the International Institute, bi-state paraquad and even some small business owners would be exempt from from even applying to get some of these funds and We have this existing social safety net that the mayor used in her. She used members of that on the advisory board to come up with some of the ideas that were putting forward in this bill. I think to exempt them simply because they came forward and kind of heeded the call to the mayor put forward to get members of the community that are a part of that safety net and have that subject matter expertise. to exempt them from being able to to apply for and receive these funds would just be a mistake. I don't think that this is the time to reinvent the wheel. Additionally, this puts forward both our own ordinance and the the applicable federal law. And I'm happy to take any questions. I think it's a pretty straightforward amendment, though. For for lack of make a motion on member number two. Yeah, I would move to adopt amendment number two. amendment number two to board bill two committees.

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  1:01:06

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  1:01:51  
By your vote you've adopted member number two to Borba number two committee substitute next before us is amendment number three. Mr. President,

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:02:01  
amendment number three is being brought by the aldermen on the 25th. Ward.

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  1:02:07  
For the 25th. Ward police proceed on amendment number three, that's before us.

Shane Cohn, 25th ward Alderman  1:02:14  
I so I don't have them and kind of logical order. Mr. President, can you

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:02:21  
remember, three is an administrative contingency fund.

Shane Cohn, 25th ward Alderman  1:02:27  
Okay. So this is basically outlining what I shared earlier, which is just restoring the contingency fund to the original $1.4 million. And, you know, is aligned with basically what our expectations might be in terms of administering the various programs that are outlined for the 154  million? I, you know, different Grant disbursals that we're working with right now.

Sarah Wood-Martin, 11th ward Alderwoman  1:02:55  
Okay, let's take questions from the committee. alderwoman. Davis. I guess my concern is most of the funds are going to various departments to be spent Department of Health, Department of Human Services, St. Louis development cooperation. And also it was a couple others. So who else needs administrative money?

Shane Cohn, 25th ward Alderman  1:03:23  
No. So this would be administered through the mayor's office to oversee the expenditure of these funds similar to what we do with proposition s, where there's a program manager that manages the grant allocation funds for those different programs that we fund from the Board of Aldermen from the Public Safety Committee. So that's a $1 million pool of money that we allocate, roughly, you know, and correct me if I'm wrong, Mr. Chair, but generally speaking, it's to about 20 different organizations or more, that we're supporting with a million, you know, roughly a million or just shy of that each year. We have a program officer that's responsible for that just for that million dollars, that's about, you know, I'd say, I want to say it's about 65,000 $70,000, salary expenditure that we automatically take off the top for that, and this is 154 million, there's obviously dozens of different allocations that will be going out that will need oversight, and they'll need reporting to the federal government as a result of those allocations as well. And so this will provide staff and other administrative expenses, you know, to basically administer the federal monies.

Sarah Wood-Martin, 11th ward Alderwoman  1:04:36  
I guess my next question is, would it be better for that contract compliance and monitoring to come out of the Comptroller's office.

Shane Cohn, 25th ward Alderman  1:04:47  
So that's what they do. So most of the departments though, that these funds are being expended by our reporting through the mayor's office, and so this would be supportive of and it's, again, very similar what we do with the proposition s funds, which, you know, go through the Public Safety Department and are administered by a employee that's in the Public Safety Department. So this is, you know, funds that are being administered through various city agencies that were put up through the mayor's office. And, you know, they'll have the staff to be able to do the various reporting and audits and whatnot to account for funds and make sure also, from a programmatic perspective, that they're doing what we're instructing them to do through these appropriations.

Sarah Wood-Martin, 11th ward Alderwoman  1:05:38  
I guess I need to think for a moment because everything you just said, again, says me back to the Comptroller's office, and those various departments that are that will be sending out RFPs they really do report back to them, not to the mayor's office. So I'm going to think about that. Thank you.

Jack Coatar, 7th ward alderman  1:06:05  
Okay, all the code. Thank you, Chairman. Um, all right. Looking at this all the minute, I guess.

I guess I'm a little bit scratching my head. That is weird. I mean, I understand we have a person in public safety, and there's a million dollar contingency for administrative costs there for those dollars, because when I guess we created those dollars, folks safety and have the Pete the bandwidth to do this. I don't really understand how someone from the mayor staff can oversee this process as part of their daily job duties, why it takes it, I guess, a special staffer simply to allocate these funds. But I guess the more troubling part, I see this amendment. And I don't know if this is a drafting error, or if this is done in an effort to just to be sneaky. The second sentence of the amendment basically authorizes E and  A to move any of the funds anywhere, it says the board of estimate enforcement is authorized to allocate contingency funds. Okay, that's fine. They're contingency funds. That's what they're for. And to reallocate 2021, Coronavirus, local fiscal recovery funds appropriated in sections three through 16. Above for the purposes described on exhibit one. I mean, that's so broad, I would think that allows DNA to just move anything around, you know, despite whatever we do here today. If I'm reading that wrong, let me know.

Shane Cohn, 25th ward Alderman  1:07:36  
So E and A, a has the ability to do that through their normal process through their normal appropriation process. So you know, anything that you might come up in where you, you know, Mr. President, you're shaking your head, but literally, we go through that with the budget process. We go through it with other federal grants that come through here. But you know, to your point, you know, why do they need staff members, and, you know, to see this, I mean, just in the first two sections alone, going to the Department of Health and the Department of Human Services, there's roughly 25 different grants that are like being awarded through those two different departments, they don't have the staffing and those departments to be able to accommodate all of the follow ups that are necessary when you're doing these types of programs. I don't know if you've had the benefit of certain sitting on the subcommittee for Prop S money, but there's a lot of legwork that goes into following up with the various agencies departments, and the federal government and other, you know, funding agencies not i

Jack Coatar, 7th ward alderman  1:08:35  
did i sat on it for three years with Chairman Kennedy.

Shane Cohn, 25th ward Alderman  1:08:38  
Great. So I mean, I, you should probably be aware that like, there is a lot of work, I mean, that person does a full time job, just administering a grant program of a million dollars to 20 different agencies, and there is a lot of follow up that's required of that individual in particular. But, you know, I think that, you know, with respect to, you know, why do you need to have, you know, additional staff. You know, as I mentioned, just the first two line items on here, as I was counting them up, it's roughly about, you know, 2025 different line items that we're sending out money to millions of dollars for various programs, and each one of those is going to have to be administered have oversight, and also, you know, make sure that they're getting done. I mean, it would be a shame if we just allocated these funds, and then none of them actually got done. I mean, that seems rather fruitless.

Jack Coatar, 7th ward alderman  1:09:45  
So Oh, I guess I still have the floor. Sorry. Okay, I guess I'm still uncomfortable with that second sentence. I appreciate your time all there and I'm gonna vote against the amendment.

Dwinderlin Evans, Alderwoman ward 4  1:09:59  
Thank you. Listening to everybody. And so I said in the beginning, when that came up that I was not comfortable. And to me, it's like, really not respecting those directors of those committee of those departments, and is not respecting the comptroller, because they all do oversight. So I just didn't I'm not comfortable. So that's where I'm at. Thanks. Okay.

Sarah Wood-Martin, 11th ward Alderwoman  1:10:34  
I have nothing Mr. Mr. Chairman. Okay. alderwoman. Martin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Um, so I just want to walk through this and make sure I understand it. It's the funds that are maybe I'm being dense here is the funds that are appropriated through lines three through 19.

Shane Cohn, 25th ward Alderman  1:10:58  
Sections sections, three,

Sarah Wood-Martin, 11th ward Alderwoman  1:10:59  
I'm sorry, section. I'm sorry, yes, section three through 19. And with this, and I don't know if you know this or not, but with the money that we're discussing today, it is executed, as grant like, in a grant manner, correct?

Shane Cohn, 25th ward Alderman  1:11:22  
Correct.

Sarah Wood-Martin, 11th ward Alderwoman  1:11:23  
It sounds like we're getting a blank check. And we're just gonna divvy it up and write these, you know, send it to each department? Correct. You have to somebody has to do the compliance work, correct.

Shane Cohn, 25th ward Alderman  1:11:34  
Their federal money. So, you know, while it's a direct stimulus from the federal government, they're still going to be federal report. It's

Sarah Wood-Martin, 11th ward Alderwoman  1:11:41  
not just sorry, you're cutting out? It's not just a check. Correct. Every single expense has to be accounted for. Correct. Okay. And the mayor's administration is basically requesting more assistance to oversee that.

Shane Cohn, 25th ward Alderman  1:12:01  
Yeah. And again, this is administrative contingency in the event that they need to hire additional staff to accommodate the appropriations that we're making here today.

Sarah Wood-Martin, 11th ward Alderwoman  1:12:11  
If we don't pass your amendment, then it defaults to the comptroller.

Shane Cohn, 25th ward Alderman  1:12:19  
I, if her staff is able to do it, I would imagine that is a possibility. But the controller was the one that recommended this contingency. You know, I mean, for those that are defaulting to the Comptroller's responsibilities, she was the one that recommended the contingency fund.

Sarah Wood-Martin, 11th ward Alderwoman  1:12:40  
Okay. All right. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Bret Narayan, 24th ward Alderman  1:12:44  
All women know all the men in the right. Thank you, Mr. Chair. So the so the comptroller, I'm just trying to make sure that I understand this. So the comptroller is responsible for the oversight of this at the moment, but the comptroller has asked for more spending out of the mayor's office to create a position to oversee this.

Shane Cohn, 25th ward Alderman  1:13:15  
This is this is potentially multiple positions. aldermen, this isn't just one position. That's, I mean, obviously, it's $1.4 million. Sure, sure. You know, so this would be things like a project manager or program manager to oversee the various funding to ensure that it's being spent in the manner according with the appropriations that we've made, it's following up and coordinating with various city departments to ensure that the appropriations that are being made are, you know, being spent in accordance with the ordinance and then also reporting back to the federal government on the different finances, as it pertains to, you know, board bill number two, and it's various appropriations.

Bret Narayan, 24th ward Alderman  1:13:56  
So the the person in charge of oversight here has

Shane Cohn, 25th ward Alderman  1:13:59  
asked for help, basically. Correct. And, you know, coming from both the mayor's office and the Comptroller's office, they're both supportive of the amendment. Okay. No further questions. Thank you. All right. I want to evidence

Dwinderlin Evans, Alderwoman ward 4  1:14:17  
Okay, I have none at this time. I've listened to some of the questions that the previous owner people have asked, and I have gotten a jet the the gist of what's been What's going on?

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  1:14:37  
Okay. This looks like some fragment lacco. Bull. I mean, such a 16. You bet we might as well just stop what we're doing today. And just not even, I mean, what's the point of going through any amendments and doing anything if EandA is just going to go around us and do what they want to do. No, that is absolutely not getting ready to happen. I can't even believe that the comptroller that we have 505 $150,000 in the Comptroller's office 250,000 for accounting service on a 30,000 for accounting and monitoring staff 125,000 financial service compliance and sub recipient monitoring 125,000 for legal service, annual and quality reporting. That's what the comptroller does. We get grants all the time. And within these grants, there are exhibits, and we tell whoever the person giving us the money, this is how we're going to spend your money. I've never been, and I've had I will be, I'll stand to be corrected if somebody prove it to me that there's a contingency that's called whatever I see need spit? that that that's not responsible government. That's not transparency. transparency, is telling us exactly what you're gonna do. Right now. This is not building a house. This is not building the building. This is staff. This is this is real money. And we're talking about spinning it on people. No, absolutely not, that there is something nefarious going on with this. And it's making us look real stupid, as far as I'm concerned. Because that language is very clear. If we pass this, we're basically saying, don't even have any more meetings, let's just let the comptroller the mayor and the president do what they want to do. I am diametrically opposed to this.

Shane Cohn, 25th ward Alderman  1:16:32  
So alderman I would be supportive of removing that specific language, that language was actually in the cares act from, you know, when we first round of stimulus money underneath President Obama. So you know, that language is language that this board has passed in the past before using stimulus funds. But I am happy to remove that particular language within this amendment, if that makes you feel more comfortable.

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  1:16:57  
What but but not only that, why we don't? Why don't we just say what we're going to use support is bigger than just you know, trying to give in a wild card, is why don't we say we're going to spend the money on that's not fair, that is not transparency to say, oh, we're gonna do 1.4 million and whatever we feel like it as the need arises, but we never have to come back to the public to say anything. We should do it right now. And I'm sorry, they were probably do it in a but who pays attention in the you know, throughout the year, right. I'm gonna call when we do more of your number one in a move that money around constantly and none of us, most of us are not paying attention to? Let's do it right now. I am. That's my my heart. No, sorry. All my code, I need you to grab this one. As chairman, okay.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:17:51  
And I was up next, I believe. All right, President read last on the list. Look, I couldn't be more against this amendment. When you look at the money that we already have in place. We have over a half a million dollars in the Comptroller's office for auditing services, accounting and monitoring services, financial services, and legal services. We have over $300,000 in the mayor's office for consulting services, project management for project management manager, and track crane and a tramp also for creating a transparency portal for again, project management staff, translation services, marketing and communication services. So that's over $800,000, nearly a million dollars of of this money that could be used elsewhere, that is going to be used for the services and I support that, which is why, you know, I'm hoping everybody supports it, because in this bill, we are taken up a second round for a second round of funding. If they're able to spin through nearly a million dollars in the next 60 to 90 days. I don't know what they're doing. So, so there is absolutely zero need for those contingency funds. When we adopt this ordinance, those that the put the accounts and the pools will be set up as outlined in the board bill. We are not giving or giving or turning over the authority to the Board of EandA to transfer that money out and use it for whatever the reason that language was in the board the previous board builders because the city was under an emergency order. And under that emergency order, and the time frame that we had I it was The best solution that we had the best thing we had going on also at that time the health director had had his ability to overspend and to move money between accounts, because again, we were under this emergency order. So, so again, I I cannot be more against an amendment than than this one. Fine. It does not do what is being advertised at all.

Shane Cohn, 25th ward Alderman  1:20:29  
Mr. President, I offered to my colleague from the 22nd. Ward, the Chairman, I am willing to remove this section that you all seem to have an issue with which is the reallocation of 2021, Coronavirus, fiscal recovery funds. Would you be open to that amendment?

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:20:48  
Yeah, absolutely not. Because, again, we're already giving both offices the mayor's office and the Comptroller's office, nearly a million dollars to provide those services that you say we need to provide with this additional $1.4 million. And I don't see any way possible for them to spend 800, some $1,000, across the next 60 to 90 days before we get through the next round of funding. And if they are I think we need to take a deep look into how they were able to spend that on staffing.

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  1:21:27  
Mr. President, are you? Yes. Okay. All the one who's on Mm hmm. Yep. I'm sorry. 

John Collins-Muhammad, 21st Ward Alderman  1:21:45  
I'm sorry. Mr. Chairman, I may have been an accident. Thank you for calling on me. Anyway, real quick. My colleague and I 25th have mentioned the past administration and occurs ACH funding. But he said under President Obama, so did you mean President Trump?

Shane Cohn, 25th ward Alderman  1:22:04  
No, I was actually referring to the AARP funds, but it was also in the cares funds for that was underneath Trump as well. Gotcha. Thank you. That's all I want to thank you. This is not uncommon language. I mean, it's used in other board bills that we've passed previously by this body. So this is not new. I mean, we have literally passed ordinances in the past, not just the cares act, but other ordinances as well, using this language, but like I said, I am happy to remove that particular language and this amendment, if it satisfies the concerns of this committee. I want to

Sarah Wood-Martin, 11th ward Alderwoman  1:22:49  
thank you. I'm older than 25th. I do have a little bit of concern, the amount does seem high. Is there any breakdown of how many people that how many people would be hired?

Shane Cohn, 25th ward Alderman  1:23:05  
Yeah, so I mean, this is a it's a contingency fund. It can be used at the mayor's office, it can be used by the Comptroller's office. And, you know, frankly, I know in the past, the president's office is used contingency funds to hire staff down at the Board of Aldermen for oversight of various programs. I believe you did that. We, we did hire someone on a temporary basis down to the Board of Aldermen underneath a CBA agreement for reporting purposes. So it was like a fiscal eight. I'm sorry, Mr. President, if

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  1:23:36  
you're with Mr. President, hold off this value, you're muted, hold up, hold up, go ahead on the call.

Shane Cohn, 25th ward Alderman  1:23:43  
But my point being is that, you know, this is it's a contingency fund, it's one that could be used by any city department. Frankly, I wouldn't include the Board of Aldermen and that as well, but certainly the mayor's office and the Comptroller's office would have access to that for administrative oversight of the funds. And also, you know, so that again, contingency in that respect, but also, you know, I think the the other important thing to note is that this is less, you know, when you look at either the various, you know, fees that we collect for sldc for development, or the, you know, grant program that we're administering through prop s, you know, it's roughly, you know, five to 10% administrative costs for just grant oversight. And, you know, having previously worked in the nonprofit sector. You know, that's also pretty standard when you're doing grant writing, from an administrative overhead perspective. And we're way short of that already with the $800,000 that the President, you know, just listed, and so, you know, the additional 1.4 million and contingency as a reserve to address any potential shortfalls that we can make sure that we are moving forward with spending these monies in a judicious manner.

Sarah Wood-Martin, 11th ward Alderwoman  1:25:03  
And then what happens if we don't spend the full amount?

Shane Cohn, 25th ward Alderman  1:25:08  
It would go back, you know, and to appropriations for future appropriations.

Sarah Wood-Martin, 11th ward Alderwoman  1:25:15  
Okay. I didn't know because of this being the youngest, obviously isn't general revenue, if it how that works. If it because everything is pretty specific, so I didn't know if that if we don't use it if we lose it, or how that,

Shane Cohn, 25th ward Alderman  1:25:37  
like many of the other things that we're talking about today, will depend upon how quickly we're able to spend money and where we're able to deploy resources, and be able to bring those resources to bear for our citizens. All right, thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  1:25:54  
Okay, I'm gonna say this, and we're going to take a vote on this. I don't think it's a fair comparison to use the prop s, because in prop s, we hire somebody to basically be the administrator of that particular set of sub grantees, just like the health department has people they issue money in your balance man example. There's so many health department that's administering that Cure Violence grant. So that's really not a fair comparison. This is almost like, you know, the fox garden chicken coop? You know, the comptroller is the fiscal watchdog for the city of St. Louis, had the comptroller said I need a million dollars, because I need I'm gonna have to hire 20 people to do all these tasks. I think that I'm willing to listen to that. But for the mayor's office to monitor their own staff, that doesn't even sound practical. So with that ultimate, do you want to make a motion on your bill, or you want to just lay it out? Because we can always, if it looks like the sky is falling these next 60 days? When we come back in September, we can put it back in there some more reasonable. What do you want to do?

Shane Cohn, 25th ward Alderman  1:27:10  
I mean, I'll take a vote on it now. Okay, let's go make a motion. Or I make a motion that we approve amendment number. What was this number three to committee substitute? 

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  1:27:31  
The motion fails for lack of a second next before us is amendment number four. amendment number four, was the president Where are we? It's either going to be the Board of Elections or the targeted cash assistant, I

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:27:52  
don't know, targeted cash assistance.

Shane Cohn, 25th ward Alderman  1:27:56  
I so this is just restoring the targeted cash assistance to the total $5 million that was initially proposed. And I'll open it up for questions from the committee.

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  1:28:11  
zeroed out, okay. I'm alderwoman. Davis. I want to Davis you're on mute. And your video went away. You're on mute?

Sarah Wood-Martin, 11th ward Alderwoman  1:28:27  
Oh, hold on. There we go. So, Mr. Chairman, one of the things that has been talked about on the federal level and the state level, that the municipality should not be trying to give any kind of stimulus money, the federal government starting July 15, there will be additional checks going out to a families with children. And there also will be they're still discussing whether or not they're going to do a fourth stimulus check for people who make under $150,000 $250 or $500. For us to try to determine who's going to get it when, you know, it just doesn't make sense. There are too many other avenues that are providing assistance that we should not be doing it. These valuable dollars should be spent on those things that benefit the city as a whole. And there is nothing that gives me any reason to say that's something we need to do. Because there's too much other money coming out. Thank you. All macoco Yeah,

Jack Coatar, 7th ward alderman  1:29:51  
I guess echoing comments are the only one for 19th I mean, there's millions and millions of dollars and assistance payments in this bill and right assistance, I mean, property real and personal property tax assistance. You know, a direct cash giveaway. I guess we've gotten some more details five minutes before this meeting started. But I'm just I'm not comfortable. There's, with this, there's already both state and federal direct cash assistance programs. I mean, the limited I know we've got a big pool of money here, but with the limited dollars we have, I'd rather spend it on on the critical city needs. We have and provide more targeted assistance than simply cash giveaways.

Pamela Boyd, 27th Ward Alder  1:30:37  
Okay, I don't want to fanboy I have no questions.

John Collins-Muhammad, 21st Ward Alderman  1:30:48  
And Mohamad. For the sake of time, Mr. Chairman, I will reserve my questions, and I will let my thoughts linger on. I have nothing Thank you,

Pamela Boyd, 27th Ward Alder  1:31:02  
Martin. Yes, thank

Sarah Wood-Martin, 11th ward Alderwoman  1:31:05  
you. Um, I guess I'm somewhat conflicted on this. I know there are so many people who need this and they're big can't wait for or, you know, can't maybe make it to the food pantry during work hours or can't wait to for grant applications and whatnot, or assistance applications. I am just wondering, so if we're taking the or if we're cutting this in half, where is the other half going?

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  1:31:42  
Oh, the amendment is to increase it from 22,000,005 to 5 million. Oh,

Sarah Wood-Martin, 11th ward Alderwoman  1:31:48  
I'm sorry. Okay, I was on the wrong. Okay. Sorry about that. Um, all right. Thank you. I understand it. No.

Bret Narayan, 24th ward Alderman  1:31:57  
Okay. All right. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Um, so I'm, 

I'm gonna go out on a limb here, I guess and say that I'm, I'm supportive of this. I don't think that we can wait. There's a lot of us here in the city that I don't think we can wait for the folks in DC to quick bickering with each other to try and bring some some direct help. I know that over in Jefferson City, they're cutting unemployment benefits that they don't necessarily have to. And with the idea that, you know, people need to get back to work. There's still people who cannot work. There's people who haven't been able to work through this. There's people who lost their entire industries through this. There's people who can't can't wait another week, they can't wait another month, they can't wait six months for us to get it together here. And if we have the ability to provide direct assistance to them in any amount, I think we should I understand that I'm likely to be outvoted on that. But that's my piece. Thank you.

Dwinderlin Evans, Alderwoman ward 4  1:33:11  
Well, alderwoman Evans, want to Evans knew. I thought I had unmuted myself. I have no questions at this time.

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  1:33:31  
Okay. I'm almost I did get a proposal. Sony appreciate it. It looks like it was pretty thoughtful. I'm curious as to how much of this is administrative costs. But that's neither here nor there. Here. 

Here's where I'm conflicted. So the federal government gave out stimulus checks. And some people, I think I'm above 80%, AMI, my household income, but I still got a stimulus check. My wife got a stimulus check. Daughters got stimulus checks. And there are people who are just a little bit above those federal guidelines. And so, you know, my daughter can't qualify for a Pell Grant. So we made a few $1,000 more. There's a lot of people in that situation. It's almost like if you're middle class or near middle class, you get punished because you don't really qualify for a lot of the government giveaways. 

And so although I think this is a very noble cause, I don't see how it can be equitable because there are people that are low income that need the money, and there are people that are not low income and even people that work for Edward Jones lost their job. I'm just making that up. I don't know what real but there are people who lost their jobs making really good money, six figures and they need a safety net as well.

 and so I'd be interested in revisiting this, you know, after the summer break to really see how we're collecting the data and how we've been equitable, you know, because equitable is a big term that right, that's the trendy term and I like equitable, but it really means something. And it's about fairness, right? Because we're all in this together. And so I'm not going to be to vote for this this time, but I might vote for it down the road in another bill, because, you know, I think it has some merit, but I just wouldn't want it to be fair for everybody. And this is complicated. This is not just like unemployment and the state gives you unemployment because you've been working and you've earned the money. And this came about basically, the correct me if I'm wrong. I was an attorney before this came about because governor Parcells basically kick people off the unemployment rolls on June 18. And so now, we're creating a safety net for those people. But all of the people that were unemployed, we're not 80% of ami.

Marlene Davis, 19th ward Alderwoman  1:36:09  
Just

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  1:36:11  
so I know, you're trying to stay somehow the one but I'm ready to take a vote on this. But I got to go to the president. He gets the last word. We're going to have the 25th. Close if after six o'clock.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:36:23  
All right. Well, thank you all. I'm, 

I'm against this proposal, for obvious reasons. When you calculate how many people this cover, I This would include about 3% of the population in the city of St. Louis, again, 3% of the population in the city of St. Louis. So these very few people were talking about in terms of giving them a very, very small check anything between 205 $100, that's not going to be transformational, the way we need it to be transformational. I think wonder all the men talked already about the amount of assistance we have and rental assistance, mortgage assistance, utility assistance, right? food pantries work on everything, right, we have all of those other things going the federal government this last year, has given some families up to $5,000 or more, right? And still, and not not one family, not 3% of the population 100% of the population of the city of St. Louis minus those that were beyond the threshold, were able to were able to get a check. And when you think about how quickly that goes, and these these the how minute of  an impact $500 would be for 3% of the population. This is a poor expenditure of money. So I i'm not i'm not supporting that to say as quickly as I can.

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  1:38:04  
I'm from the 25th where I am confused. I started out by saying I thought we're zeroed out that we did that's not in the committee substitute the $2.5 million for targeted cash assistance that's not in it. See, this is zero. So So did you mean is amendment for something different?

Shane Cohn, 25th ward Alderman  1:38:26  
I would, I would insert a line and to the bill. For a section, like a section 13

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  1:38:36  
we got to go to Section 37. I know for a fact targeted cash assistance is zero because we went through that presentation. So we got to go back to work. What is section 13? Same?

Shane Cohn, 25th ward Alderman  1:38:46  
Well, so this would be replacing section 13 and you know, every subsequent section would become a new section kind of a thing.

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  1:38:57  
But you're saying beginning on page 10 lines here before the words before the word section 13 correct.

Shane Cohn, 25th ward Alderman  1:39:03  
nervine here about appropriate THUMB UP 2.5 million routine and then every other section would become 14 1516, etc. It's similar to the next one I'm introducing.

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  1:39:14  
So this should really say section 14

Shane Cohn, 25th ward Alderman  1:39:20  
No, because it's before section 13. So it's before the appropriation to the Board of Health. Okay, so sources so that's coming up sections. Kind of written kind of confusing. Okay, all right. Got it. Well, it's gonna be hard no for me. Do you want to make a motion song you? Well, so I what I would like to do is just close out by saying, you know, this is targeted assistance to the most needy of our citizens. We just had a very lengthy conversation with With respect to, you know, the unhoused and you know how many of us like, don't want them in our neighborhoods and are trying to, you know, take care of Don, how is then, you know, the, this is a targeted direct assistance for individuals making less than $46,500 a year. $46,500 a year, or a family of four, that makes less than 66, basically $66,000 a year. 

You know, $500 might not seem like a lot to President read, but it sure that that might make the world of difference to be putting food on the table, or making a car payment or being able to get the work, you know, for young people or, you know, getting a leg up to get a job, I should say, for other people. And I just, I'm having a very difficult time reconciling some of the comments that are being made right now. You know, to be equitable, you know, someone who's making $140,000 it, you know, Wells Fargo, or, you know, Edward Jones, or someplace else more than likely has had the ability to create a safety net for themselves, that might include a savings account that can spare them for a month or two. You know, individuals that are making $40,000 a year don't have that same ability. 

You know, I mean, this goes back to some of the conversations we were having around, raise the wage and you know, $15 minimum wage, it's really difficult. And I think many of us can appreciate that and understand that it's very difficult to support yourself, let alone a family, and, you know, $40,000 or $46,000. And especially when you end up losing a job. So, you know, I'll renew my motion, but I would hope for favorable consideration of this to be able to help our citizens that are desperately in need right now.

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  1:41:58  
Okay, let me back up. Again, I think that some grommets are maybe before we take an official vote on it because I'm looking at the board bill section 13 section 13 says there are bad so simply put section 13 there are hereby appropriated the sum of $2,500,000 of the 2020 micronas Bowers, local fiscal recovery fund to the Board of Public Service new again as they say so you want to replace that and say go back to and it's too much more back for the amendment. So you want to limit number I wish he was in person, this would be a lot easier. Okay, so you don't so then you're wasting so you create a new 13 but how do we reconcile everything else is pushed down to 40? Because then we have to 13

Shane Cohn, 25th ward Alderman  1:43:10  
No, it gets updated by the clerk.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:43:14  
I don't know. I've never really would have to have we would have to have amendments all the way down. Oh, no Chairman point of order guys. Okay, there is

Jack Coatar, 7th ward alderman  1:43:24  
the last line there after his new section 13 says to further amend the ordinance by amending a subsequent section numbers and relevant section references accordingly. So instead of tapping at the end, he's doing it. I don't know why I'm 30. But it would be okay. You wouldn't

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  1:43:42  
I missed that line. And he I think he said that so I apologize on the 25th but Okay, so he's he's made the motion is on the floor to adopt amendment number four. Second, movement second, Madam Clerk, please call the roll.

Sharon Tyus, 1st ward Alderwoman  1:43:57

Okay, by your vote, you fail to sustain a motion of our from the 25th Ward on amendment number four next before us. Is amendment number five, I'm gonna call on my vice chair to handle revenue. till I get back, thank you.

Jack Coatar, 7th ward alderman  1:45:09  
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, amendment number five aldermen for the 25th is your amendment?

Shane Cohn, 25th ward Alderman  1:45:16  
It is okay. On your, your your recognized.

Jack Coatar, 7th ward alderman  1:45:21  
Give us a brief description. What is amendment number five?

Shane Cohn, 25th ward Alderman  1:45:24  
Yeah. So amendment number five is essentially allowing the board of elections to become prepared for our next pandemic and or emergency or the escalation of the current pandemic that we're in by appropriating funds in order to support anywhere voting in the city. Currently, it takes a ton of work to create voting super centers that we had with COVID. And I've been working with the board of elections, roughly about last March, I want to say, you know, to go through the process to identify the appropriate amount of funds that would be necessary in order to move forward with this, the county actually implemented a similar system for the last election cycle, that allow them a lot more flexibility and agility and being able to hold their elections. And, you know, on a side note, unrelated to, you know, emergency preparedness, I think many of us encounter at our own polling places, situations where people become unhoused, or moved or change jobs, or what have you, and end up at the incorrect polling place, or a polling place changes, which happens pretty frequently lately, and people end up at the wrong polling place, or in the wrong precinct, or what have you. And this will help remedy some of those issues as well. The estimates from the Board of Elections is generally around two to two and a half million dollars for the hardware. And then anywhere from one and a half million to two and a half million dollars to update their processes, do the training for all of the poll workers, the staff, etc, and actually update software and things of that nature on the cities and in order to implement this going forward. So I know, I you know, I believe president Reid and I have had conversations about this and the probably last year at some point. I've had conversations with the comptroller, she's supportive. The mayor is supportive. And I know many of our colleagues have indicated that they're supportive as well.

Jack Coatar, 7th ward alderman  1:47:35  
And thank you, Chairman, and thank you all there in common. Let's go down and take questions from members of that committee. alder woman days.

Marlene Davis, 19th ward Alderwoman  1:47:44  
I'm just gonna listen for a few minutes. Thank you. All right. I'm all there. Woman boy, I

Dwinderlin Evans, Alderwoman ward 4  1:47:53  
guess. I guess my question, could I ask the question augmon shine, course. Oh, okay. Thank you. I'm ashamed. I guess my question cuz I think you and I have spoken in regards to this board of elections. And when they came before me on ways and means I always question because we have no authority with the board of election. Because I was told that understate. But we asked for money for him. And so I never understood that that didn't make sense to me. And so if state mandates and while we give them dollars, wow.

Shane Cohn, 25th ward Alderman  1:48:33  
Yeah. Sorry, older woman, I didn't mean to cut you off there at the end. So the Board of Elections is created underneath state statute. And, you know, it's a separate entity from the city, but it is fully funded by the city, just as the Board of Elections and the county is funded by St. Louis County. So we we actually are responsible for expenditures related to that, and can set policy with respect to our own elections as an independent city. And so, you know, just like prop are passed by the citizens of the the city, which did the rank choice voting or what have you, you know, that was basically directed at the St. Louis city board of elections. So that, you know, it's a commission that's set up, that's a bipartisan commission. You know, they've got republicans and democrats that are represented on there, and then we are responsible for supporting their budget and allocating and appropriating funds for them. So the conversations that I had started last year with respect to just being able to be prepared, and the pandemic and of course, you know, we were facing budget shortages last year when these discussions started. And, you know, the administration at the time was having a difficult time trying to find money to allocate those and then when this opportunity presented itself, I circled back and start I'm having conversations again, whether or not this would be an appropriate use of these funds. And by and large folks have agreed.

Dwinderlin Evans, Alderwoman ward 4  1:50:08  
Okay, I didn't have a conversation. So that's why I'm asking this question. Okay. Thank you.

Sarah Wood-Martin, 11th ward Alderwoman  1:50:16  
Thank you all. And woman all the recounts Muhammad? All right, moving on all their one Martin. No questions. Sounds good to me. Thanks. All women know, Ryan.

Bret Narayan, 24th ward Alderman  1:50:34  
Thank you, Vice Chair. Just one question. So we don't have to be assuming that this funding went through. And, you know, and the board bill pass, we would not have to be in any state of emergency like COVID for this vote anywhere to come into play? Or would we have to wait for some action from the state or? No, this is essentially providing the funding to update our infrastructure, and order to be prepared for future emergencies. So we don't need any emergency orders or anything of that

Shane Cohn, 25th ward Alderman  1:51:08  
nature to move forward with implementation, or using it and any potential election cycle. It's literally just to update our IT infrastructure and electioneering tools that we use on a regular basis. And then also the, you know, the software and staff training and processes and everything else that are associated with with administering the elections. But it doesn't need to be done underneath an emergency order. This will be infrastructure that we'll be able to use on a regular basis.

Bret Narayan, 24th ward Alderman  1:51:39  
So So ultimately, at the end of the day, this money just makes it easier for for every St. Louis to vote. Yep. 100. Perfect. But thank you so much. Thank you, alderman alderwoman.

Dwinderlin Evans, Alderwoman ward 4  1:51:53  
Evans. Yes. Thank you, Chair. What's the amount of money that's involved in in this? Now? Is this an amendment? Are? And if so, which one?

Shane Cohn, 25th ward Alderman  1:52:08  
Yeah, it I believe it's amendment number five, if I'm not mistaken, is that correct, Mr. President, amendment number five, and the total appropriation would be for $5 million.

Dwinderlin Evans, Alderwoman ward 4  1:52:27  
And those monies would be used for summarize it,

Shane Cohn, 25th ward Alderman  1:52:33  
to update our electioneering systems, so that any resident of the city can vote in any polling place in the city of St. Louis. They can if they work close to, you know, Natural Bridge, but they live in dutchtown, they can vote in dutchtown, or they can vote at a polling place next to their work and on Natural Bridge. They can literally move anywhere they want to cast a ballot, and all of the information for their various precincts will be available at those precincts going forward at any precinct in the city.

Dwinderlin Evans, Alderwoman ward 4  1:53:05  
Wouldn't that cause confusion?

Shane Cohn, 25th ward Alderman  1:53:08  
No, because they'll still get a card that's mailed to them that says, Here's your polling place, and here's where you go. And they'll be able to pull out their driver's license or you know, whatever form of ID that's necessary to vote. And the board of elections will literally be able to pull them up in their system and give them the ballot that's respective for them. It's extremely easy, very simple, and it won't. People won't get turned away at the ballot box any longer. Okay,

Dwinderlin Evans, Alderwoman ward 4  1:53:35  
so even though they are from a different precinct are in Ward or whatever? I don't know, it sounds a little confusing to me. So how do they keep track off? Well, all of the technology beyond be as one so that when a name is put into it, that it shows whether that person has voted or not? Correct?

Shane Cohn, 25th ward Alderman  1:54:11  
Yes, absolutely. So it's just like you walk into your normal polling place, and you tell them what precinct you're in. And, you know, by your ID, they'll know what precinct and Ward you're in, and they'll give you the ballot for that respective election. It'll have your, you know, various propositions on there, the judges that are on there, the Community College Trustees that are at you know, for your district, the state rep for your district, the state senator. But if you happen to accidentally go to the wrong polling place, or you go to a polling place that's closer to you. I don't know about you alderwoman. But I have only two polling places in my ward. And so some of my neighbors actually live closer to polling places that are on the boundaries of my ward like the 13th Ward or the 11th ward. They would actually literally be able to walk across the street to the polling place at Woodard school and cast a ballot down there versus having to drive a mile to cast a ballot at another polling place. But they'll still get the card from the board of elections that has their respective polling place, the date of the election and all of that fun stuff.

Dwinderlin Evans, Alderwoman ward 4  1:55:23  
Okay. I just think is confused. It would be confusing. I don't know. I'm, I'm finished. No further questions.

Jack Coatar, 7th ward alderman  1:55:35  
Thank you all the woman. mitre all in thank you for sponsoring this. I was pleased to see it. And this is I was having some similar conversations with our friends of the election board. Yeah, I mean, this as you summarized it, well, I'm supporting this amendment. This is very our elections, you know, into into modern times, we're still we're still utilizing equipment from the unfunded federal mandate to Help America Vote Act 2002. Our election equipment, including our touchscreens are from 2000 to think of how many devices, electronic devices you still have in your house from 2002. I willing to wager not many. So this would get us a much needed update equipment. And based on conversation with you and some staff at the election board, this is the appropriate amount of money to need, both for the physical equipment and the training. So I will be supporting this amendment. Thank you for bringing it president Reid. Any questions? Any for any comments?

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:56:30  
Oh, thank you. First. You know, ultimate con is you know, we've we've, we've spoken, I think anywhere voting and making it easier for people to vote is important. Only thing, my only worry is the lateness of it to give us an opportunity to vet this to make sure that we are 100% positive that this is a an acceptable use, and that the number is, you know, a comprehensive number for what the election board needs. So what I would, what I would ask is, if we could take it up Friday as an amendment, or included in the next stimulus package, which we're going to begin working on right away. Um, I think that still would be plenty of time for them to move forward and get done what they need to get done. But I just don't feel like I have enough information about it today, because we didn't, we didn't get it as part of the some of those recommendations, because that gave us time to really dive into those things and the vetem and reach out to some of our national partners to see if indeed, that use would fit and you know, how it would be structured, so, so forth. So that would give us a little more time on it. And, you know, again, I think it's important, I think it's one that we need to do. The only thing is just not prepared for it today only because it we just we just got noticing. We didn't notice it summit today.

Shane Cohn, 25th ward Alderman  1:58:21  
I mean, many of us respectfully, Mr. President, just got notice of $70 million in extra expenditures yesterday afternoon, the year

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:58:30  
that came from members of the board you are, which

Shane Cohn, 25th ward Alderman  1:58:34  
I see. So Mr. President, and those were required by Friday at 5pm on a holiday weekend, and I'm not sure how many people were able to devote time over the holiday weekend for through screening all of that. But also, in addition to that, I would add that there were questions out there whether or not we were talking about the $80 million, or with we were able to expand even more than that, which I didn't get an email answering that either. So I withheld recommendations. You know, because of that, because I didn't get a response about it. But I you know, I would say, you know, to answer your question, though, with respect to whether or not it's the appropriate amount, and you know, what our partners are saying, you know, the Board of Elections has been in the process of putting in our RFQ together already. They've already gotten preliminary estimates based off of the county's implementation of this a year and a half ago. So, you know, these are these are real numbers. These are, you know, based on fact, and it's based off of recommendations from the board of elections. So nothing's going to change between today and Friday. So I prefer to get it handled today. And certainly, we have another election coming up in August. So it would be nice to be able to get some of this stuff, you know, hopefully moving forward, potentially in time to address you know, those elections coming up at the end of the year.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:59:57  
Again, all women Oh, no, I'm just not prepared to, to vote on it today. Only because like I said, we were just now found out about this at the start of the meeting. And I'm not trying to offend you with that statement. I'm just trying to appeal to you to say, you know, if you give us more time, we can probably get this done. I think it's important when we get done. But you know, again, I don't I have no idea about the number that came from the election board is that an inclusive numbers match number, I mean, all of these things are the length of time for project is that a lot of things related to that, that we have, like no insight into?

Shane Cohn, 25th ward Alderman  2:00:57  
I literally covered that for you, Mr. But when it's the cover, it covers all of the hard cost. It covers the training for the staff, and, you know, the volunteers, the poll workers, it'll need to be trained on all of these things as well, and

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  2:01:10  
hardware they get off.

Shane Cohn, 25th ward Alderman  2:01:12  
So they have to go through the RFP process for that, but based off of the estimates,

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  2:01:18  
so the hardware that the hardware that they would receive, would it replace the existing hardware,

Shane Cohn, 25th ward Alderman  2:01:24  
right? Every piece of equipment

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  2:01:28  
100% of the hardware would be replaced forever. And the the additional hardware that they would get, what type of infrastructure improvements would they need? Depending on the hardware that they get, they'd probably be different bandwidth requirements. And that sort of stuff, what type of food and software upgrades would they need?

Shane Cohn, 25th ward Alderman  2:01:52  
I and I specifically mentioned those things and the costs the $5 million costs, so the hardware costs

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  2:01:59  
is $5 million. But your Amendment says $1.7 million, I believe

Shane Cohn, 25th ward Alderman  2:02:04  
that's 5 million. The clerk should have updated that the 1.7 million is literally for the hardware costs. So the 5 million is for the total costs.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  2:02:17  
The minimum I'm looking at is $1.7 million.

Jack Coatar, 7th ward alderman  2:02:20  
Chairman or Mr. President, Miss, you may update your Google Drive. There's definitely a document from the 25th has an amendment it's it's labeled as amendment five, a I think you've replaced the other one you replaced?

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  2:02:35  
Yes. So but again, my question is still remains still there. You know, as an IT person, you know that, you know, those questions that I have have not been answered. And again, I'm I'm trying to appeal to you. Just work with us, so that we can get our arms around it and get it done. Because,

Shane Cohn, 25th ward Alderman  2:03:10  
Mr. President, I'm happy to do that. I just I, I'd like to be more clear about what's going to happen between today and Friday. That's a day and a half to make you change

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  2:03:22  
your mind. Okay. Because here's one of the other issues is that the capital committee had it listed at $3 million. So we have a, we have the original 1.7, a new bill, a new amendment at five. And the capital committee that did the thorough review of it was that three. So that's what that $2 million is a massive gap. And those funds could be allocated somewhere else opposed to just sitting in the pot, waiting and losing some of the questions, some of the things that we have now, I'll have the email sent to you where the capital committee went through a review and had a proposal and had $3 million allocated to it. I'm just saying, I'm not trying to get into all that with you.

Shane Cohn, 25th ward Alderman  2:04:13  
I'm not, I don't

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  2:04:15  
appeal to you to say give us some time on it.

Shane Cohn, 25th ward Alderman  2:04:18  
I'm not taking it that way. I just I asked the question to be transparent and be open and have some expectations that I was not aware that the capital committee had even allocated funds for it. So that's good to know,

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  2:04:31  
that our kit that they looked at it, they did an analysis of

Shane Cohn, 25th ward Alderman  2:04:36  
so you know, I'm if that's the case, then I'm happy to set up a conversation with you tomorrow to see what information needs to be, you know, reviewed or undertaken. And I mean, I certainly have the board of elections on speed dial at this point in time, so I'm sure that they'd be happy to participate.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  2:04:55  
All right. I think we I think we all do but let's let's do that. Let's get together tomorrow on my get it figured out some get that one down to, you know, like Santa Barbara. I think we need to get it done. Let's just make sure we knock it out of Park. Thanks. Thanks.

Shane Cohn, 25th ward Alderman  2:05:10  
I'll withdraw the amendment and have another one available for Friday, I suppose. All right. Thank you all for the 25th I guess we're gonna keep moving here. We are on amendment number six, President Reed who is offering amendment number six.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  2:05:28  
I'm working on amendment number six. amendment number six begins on page one, line five and strikes out the following words containing a severability clause. Beginning on page 28. Line, one strikes out the following the following section eight severability clause, it is hereby declared to be the intentions of the board evolving that each and every part of this and then it goes on related to the severability clause. Because of the nature of this bill. And all of the work that we've done to assure that these funding pools are are appropriate, that they are viable, and they are allowed under the Act. We do not need to sell Billy Claus. So I would make a motion that we strike that I would like to make a motion for the adoption of amendment number six.

Jack Coatar, 7th ward alderman  2:25:36  
Where Let me ask this, where's this money moving from? Where is it going currently?

Sarah Wood-Martin, 11th ward Alderwoman  2:25:43  
Sorry, hang on. I'm lying. page five, line 14. Sorry, I

thought I had my exhibit set up.

This would go from the money that was appropriated for City Housing Development Fund, and then into affordable housing. So there's in Waterville, two, there's a separate fund for City Housing Development Fund, and this would send it over to the Affordable Housing Commission.

Jack Coatar, 7th ward alderman  2:26:22  
Okay, the City Housing Development Fund, and Sorry, I'm looking at the I guess, looking at the exhibit. Where's that money currently? Oh, I see. It's in sldc.

Sarah Wood-Martin, 11th ward Alderwoman  2:26:34  
Yes, I'm sorry. And I had that my notes. Yes. Sorry. Both the minutes were from sldc.

Jack Coatar, 7th ward alderman  2:26:45  
Okay, let's go through and see if there's any questions and members of the committee. Apologies. I got to pull up my list again. I should have this memorized. alder woman datas.

Sarah Wood-Martin, 11th ward Alderwoman  2:27:00  
I currently believe that it needs to be separate. All we do need some separate development other than affordable. So I was suggested to stay where it is.

Jack Coatar, 7th ward alderman  2:27:10  
Okay. Alderman Cohn No questions. alder woman boy. No questions. All women, Collins Mohamad. Know, Mr. Vice Chair. All the men know Ryan. No questions. Thank you. alderwoman. Evans, no questions.

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  2:27:40  
Okay. Chairman Boyd. Yeah, thank you, Mr. Vice Chair. I understand why they went from 11 wants to move this money to infrastructure is already set up over there. But what I'm excited about with with the funds that we're getting now is we don't have to do it the way we've always been doing it. And the criteria for affordable housing. And it's, it's not as simple as how sldc can do things. And for miles, I just think it has a lot of money right now. never spend, I like to see slbc I like to see sldc rather than affordable house. That's just my thought. Okay, thank you, Chairman.

Jack Coatar, 7th ward alderman  2:28:27  
I guess I'm gonna go ahead and take the liberty ask a question all a woman does any or does anybody I guess I'll direct to the aldermen from 11. Do you have any understanding why is this currently in sldc that a $20 million line item? I mean, do we know why? I guess it was recommended that it go the money go there versus affordable housing.

Sarah Wood-Martin, 11th ward Alderwoman  2:28:49  
I think like some of our colleagues have said that they wanted to separate fund. And it wouldn't be the same setup as the Affordable Housing Trust. But when we were talking about administration cost earlier, it's sort of why reinvent the wheel. And so I just was trying to consolidate where some of these funds are housed and administered. Okay, I'm alright with that.

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  2:29:21  
Yeah, I just realized that's the $20 million that we put in on citywide housing development. Right. Right out a woman from 11.

Sarah Wood-Martin, 11th ward Alderwoman  2:29:30  
I'm sorry, sorry, my computer's dying. Yeah, that

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  2:29:33  
that was the $20 million for city wide housing development, correct? Yeah. And so the reason that I had that place and sldc again, it's because it CDA is too cumbersome with the with the regulations. Some of the affordable housing money gets bogged down in bureaucracy, and I just think sldc gets to create a new opportunity for us to be able to do housing production without some of the red tape Did you have to go through with affordable housing and CDA, so that's why I recommended that it go in that pot, and they do have the expertise to get it done it. We do it all the time. Yeah. I mean, CDA does certain things through block grant money and SL, D. C, do things through a different pot of money. So it's just a different AC doing the same thing, kind of sort of Urban League does a home repair, better frame lights does Home Repair. So we're not limited. But I just think we have a better shot at really getting this money out the door with sldc versus affordable house and so I want to stand on that. So I can't support them. Okay, thank you, alderman. Any

Jack Coatar, 7th ward alderman  2:30:45  
other discussion on what is the amendment number 11? Going once, going twice. All right. We'll entertain a motion on amendment number 11. To board bill to committee substitute

Tom Shepard, Chief of Staff PBOA  2:31:07  
all the women do you have an emotion all the ones in the 11? Oh, sorry.

Sarah Wood-Martin, 11th ward Alderwoman  2:31:12  
I'd like to make a motion on amendment number 11. Please.

Shane Cohn, 25th ward Alderman  2:31:17  
Second.

Jack Coatar, 7th ward alderman  2:31:18  
It's been moved by the all the woman from the 11th seconded by I think that was the argument from the 25th that we adopt medmen 11. Two board bill to committee substitute. Madam Clerk, please call the roll.

Sharon Tyus, 1st ward Alderwoman  2:31:31

Jack Coatar, 7th ward alderman  2:32:26  
Okay, buy your book your sale to stand in motion all the way from the 11th. amendment number 11. fails. Shy folks. We've got one more amendment number 12. That was just added to your drives. It is in there now. You may have to refresh but it's there. I'll handle this amendment. It is. It is an amendment. We just realized as we're going through this that the $5 million for police overtime that we discussed and included in the exhibit doesn't have a section in the bill. So amendment number 12. Two more bill to committee substitute would amend board bill page 28. There's an error there that says page 28 should be page 28 line 15 after the words passagen approval by the mayor adding a new section 20 thereby appropriated $5 million dollars or 2020 Coronavirus, local fiscal recovery funds to the police department for the purposes of police overtime overtime account 6505172 which is the commissioned officers and counts. I'm going to ignore this amendment. I'll move to adopt amendment number 12. To board bill to committee substitute.

It's been moved by me seconded by the all of them for the 19th I'll go ahead and see if there's any questions on this run down the list all the woman days.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  2:37:45  
No, we don't we had our comment on the bill. If you to kind of give you an idea of the way it would work. So if we would have to go back and have public comment. Every time we would make a substantial amendment that would affect the fact we would never get a bill out of committee, let alone if we did a four substitute on the Florida board. We'd have to bring it all back to committee. Sure. Sure.

Bret Narayan, 24th ward Alderman  2:38:11

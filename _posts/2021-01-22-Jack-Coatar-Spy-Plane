Jack Coatar, Alderman ward 7: So between the unproven nature of this tool, the fact that it’s of -- I think -- little evidentiary value in the courts, the privacy concerns that I have that are real, I mean we can be flippant about the fact that we live in a world where we’re much more connected and being we're being tracked and we’re getting ads on our phones and things, and that’s all true, but again I get to back to there’s certain places that are domicile, that are private and you should be to be there without the fear of aerial surveillance. I think people’s homes is one of those places, or walking in the middle of a public park. So I have those concerns.

A third really big concern of mine, and I welcome it if the Alderman from the 16th can shed some light on this or wants to weigh in, but the funding concerns. I believe I have read the agreement, I thought the first agreement made it clear the city is not on the hook financially for this. I trust that the floor substitute, the correct floor substitute that’s now before us, further belt and suspenders that point that the city is not on the hook for this. 

It has indemnification provisions saying that we’re not on the hook for the, I guess, Persistent Surveillance is on the hook, for legal fees associated with any litigation stemming from this technology.  So, I actually think the city’s well protected in that respect in this contract.

My concern is the lack of clarity of how this is being funded. What crime detector entity? What foundation is funding this? I know we heard the Arnold Foundation is involved but now they’ve come back and said ‘well no we’re not doing this without city involvement’ so it’s not clear to me. There’s a lot of references to the funder within the agreement and within the terms of use. 

I think we as citizens, I think the people who will be subject to this surveillance should have, are entitled to that information. To know who's gonna pay for this, what organization is paying for this surveillance. If this is such a good idea, and such a worthwhile project, it’s interesting to me, that the funders won’t come forth and say so.

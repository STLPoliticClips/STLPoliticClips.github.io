Joe Vaccaro, Alderman ward 23: I can tell you I've had multiple complaints about that building. As goofy as this will sound, the guy that was living in that building said he was going to have the Russian Mafia come and visit me. That he was with some Spy Agency. 

Then, he was gone and I was just made first aware of this when SLDC asked me as the Alderman of that ward.

Tishaura Jones, 4:43: I also have to note here that there are substantive disagreements with this proposal, which are neither comprehensive nor innovative, and have designed to meet the needs of developers not working families. When I'm talking about the economic development piece of this proposal. federal guidelines clearly provide that the American rescue plan Act funds may not be used for economic development. There are some limited exceptions, affordable housing, workforce development facade improvements and technical assistance for small businesses and, and prospective entrepreneurs but the incentives to subsidize develop developer construction cost detailed and President reads amendment are clearly in an ineligible expense. 

5:09 The Biden administration's guiding principle is simple. These dollars are meant for public good, not private profit. We propose multiple fixes to the language that will follow US Treasury regulations, and actually put more money in some more areas of North St. Louis, our executive director of sldc, Neal Richardson sent the Board of Aldermen a letter detailing the flaws in the approach and included two amendments to correct them. They have been ignored.
 And, and there was board and the board was forced to vote prematurely and debate and shut down and Alderwoman trying to do reintroduced the amendment. Let me make this clear. I grew up in and still live in North St. Louis. So I could not be more aligned with the presidentâ€™s stated intent. 

6:00 But I also understand that people come before buildings, and that dispersing Direct Relief to families in crisis is the best way is the best thing we can do to strengthen the local economy. These funds will be subject to immense federal scrutiny. And when auditors find that we've allocated funds for development incentives, we will be required to pay it back.

Tishaura Jones, 9:57: I'm proud of how faith labor and community leaders came together to save the $500 direct payments for 1000s of St. Louisians after President Reed stripped them from the bill. Let me say this. President Reed showed the same zeal for researching US Treasury rules as he did for taking $500 payments away from St. Louis families, families would have relief by now. And though I hope that the President might take the responsible route and amend his bill, in order to ensure that we don't lose federal funds, the truth is that St. Louis residents cannot wait. President Reed has told us that he won't change a single period on this bill. This puts our city in a very vulnerable position. But we can't let political games slow us down any further, we need to move forward. And so today in the best interest of the city, and residents, I'll be voting to pass for Bill two out of the board of Estimate and Apportionment. 

Clip C: Jim Brown discussing rule and how its not changing

Jim Brown 15:14 There is no indication whatsoever that the 2.8 as its referred to governing, the use of economic development opportunities for these funds is going to be changed. It's very unlikely that they are going to change the parameter of the existing rule. Specifically, it says on Page 26788, eligible uses uses "may recipients use funds for general economic development period. Answer, no." It's it goes on receipts, "recipients must demonstrate that the funding is for economic impact of covid 19, of the COVID-19 related emergency only." And that covers a huge area of all the other things that are in board bill two, and so on. 

So given these other economic activities that are coming your way, and they're great opportunities, and I think in addition to this 500 million, we are we will be the beneficiaries of some of this new money coming down the pike. My recommendation would be to precedent read to defer, defer now and take this section, six out.

Clip D: Jim Brown warning about Treasury

Jim Brown, 17:13 I would close out by saying that. I've been up here for 40 years representing you all, Mayor Jones is my seventh mayor. And I have seen and worked with a lot of federal agencies. And I want to tell you, there's one agency up here You do not want to mess with. And that's Treasury. And there are going to be audits on this bill. Excuse me, not on this bill. But there will be audits on the American Recovery Act and this 500 million that we received, and the 65 billion that other cities are receiving all across the country, there's going to be audits that may not be in 21. But there'll be in 22, and 23 and 24. And the one thing you the city does not want to trigger is a clawback. And they have made callbacks many times on different programs and all these different federal agencies. And if you know if they get a clawback through an audit in three years, where are you going to find that money, you're going to have to go pull it back from something else or take it out of general revenues. 

Clip E: Jim Brown warning about audit

Jim Brown, 28:35: Yes, the appropriators for the ones that they express the city's intent. And Treasury is basically saying that in this particular case, or what they would say is that it was the intent of the city to expend these funds for economic development purposes that were not allowed in the rules. And then what happens in terms of implementation is is a whole nother story. And most of them, would base the audit on the intent, which is the appropriations.

Lewis Reed 29:06: Mr. Brown I'm I'm sorry, that that that is one of the most outrageous statements I've ever heard. So you're saying that that that the federal government would clawback funds based on your intent and not what you finally spent the funds on and the process and the authorization and the reviews that happened during that process? That's what you're saying what they do? You're gonna have to show me that that that's the most outrageous thing I've ever heard.

Jim Brown: By your board bill, you are sending a signal that you are not following the Treasury guidance and that by itself will trigger could possibly trigger a review. 
Clip F: Lewis Reed tries to bring Elkin Kristner on and is rejected

Lewis Reed 29:52: You know, I have, we have our attorney on here, Mr. Elton Kistner and also by I just want to...

Tishaura Jones: Lewis. Elkin Kistner is not a contractor of the city of St. Louis.

Lewis Reed: He is an authorized contractor of the city of St. Louis, 

Tishaura Jones:  Was that contract brought before E and A? 

Lewis Reed: No, I'm paying, I'm paying Elkin. I'm raising money and also paying Elkin personally if I have to, to get this thing moving, because it's that important for the city of St. Louis, that we cut through the politics. So that's why we're here.

Tishaura Jones: I'm asking because, you know, as, as mayor, I'm not sure if this is appropriate. Comptroller Green?

Lewis Reed: that's okay. I don't, we

Darlene Green: It is not appropriate to have a member from outside of E&A. We can enter into a vote. However, if we would like to hear from someone who is not a member of na, we have agreed to hear from Jim Brown. Now, Mr. President Reed, if you understand the rules, we cannot have you as one member of E and A, to bring on someone that has not been agreed to.

Lewis Reed: I agree with that.

Annie Rice, Alderwoman ward 8: And what we know does work, is relationships, is community, is Cure Violence moving in and speaking to people on the ground where they live. Itâ€™s people speaking to each other as neighbors and like Sal Martinez spoke at our hearing on Cure Violence, watching the young kid with a giant gun down the street, but trying to get him a job, right? Deterring that violent activity into getting a job.

Those are the things that work to tamp down on violent crime in our city. That builds relationships. That builds trust. Not layers upon layers of surveillance technology. 

I just wanna thank everyone for speaking and wanted to make sure that I had the opportunity to add onto those questions asked earlier. Thank you.

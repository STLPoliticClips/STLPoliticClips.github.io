Tom Oldenburg, Alderman ward 16  17:50
you. In the spirit of compromise. Colleagues, I'm hoping for your agreement to reconsider My plan is to put this board bill back on the perfection calendar, then put it on the informal calendar. I've been in pretty intense conversations with the public safety directors office over the last 24 hours. And I think it's important to have their buy in I think we will have their buy in on this ordinance. With again, some compromised measures in place from from both sides. It's important if this is going to be implemented that we do have their their full buy in. And I would like it to be certainly recognized that we have 17 votes for this when we perfected it. And the sponsor of this poll is certainly under no obligation to reconsider when you have the votes. But I hope that the this spirit of compromise and the sincerity of it will also echo to some of my colleagues who bring forth hollow compromise. So with that, Mr. President, I look forward to the vote.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  18:55
All right. Alderwoman, from the 19th.

Marlene Davis, Alderwoman ward 19  18:58
Thank you, Mr. President, members of the board. I too, had an opportunity to speak with a Director of Public Safety. I was talking to him about something else and he brought it up. I am in total support of this move. I believe he has some great ideas that we will all support. And I really appreciate the Alderman from the 16th ward. Understanding this and taking this opportunity to work in partnership with the director. So I do support this as well. Thank you.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  19:34
All right. Excellent Alderman from the twenty-second.

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  19:39
Yes, thank you, Mr. President, members, the board with the Alderman from the 16th. yield,

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  19:44
Alderman from the 16th. We yield to Alderwoman from the second. Well, yes, on from Tom, please proceed.

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  19:51
Thank you, and thank you, alderman. I just have a question. You mentioned compromise. And I'm not sure if we clearly understand what that means and more. Can you explain to me you know what that looks like, you know, uncompromising on

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  20:08
a bill on Alderman from the twenty-second. Can you hold that one until after we do the motion to reconsider? A less and less? Are you planning on hold on hold, Mr. President? Oh, no. Hold on for a second on Alderman from the 16th? Are you you're not going to take any additional action to amend the bill or anything today. You're just moving it to them from all in from 22nd. Proceed.

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  20:35
Okay, thank you. So back to my original question. restate that, it seems like we've lost our sense of what compromise looks like in this body and with this administration. So can you just share with me, you know, what your thoughts of what compromise looks like and how we can actually move with bill forward in the best interest of our citizens? What's your expectation? Certainly,

Tom Oldenburg, Alderman ward 16  21:01
alderman. And I appreciate the question. Yeah, I mean, I think, you know, leadership, is the very definition of it is is willing to sincerely give and take when you're trying to get to a certain policy goal. And I saw that demonstrated from the public safety director and his office. So I was, you know, extremely impressed with that. And to the Alderwoman, from the 19th point, there's some good ideas to make this ordinance better, as opposed to just ramming it through and not necessarily having everyone say, Hey, we all agreed on something. It's It's a rare day. It's City Hall when when something like that happens, and I believe it's unfolding in front of us. So I appreciate your question, because I think we can always try to not personalize things and understand what compromise really means. And I think we'll see it in board bill 61 for substitute when we come together with the language and re perfected in subsequent means.

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  22:00
And would you agree that compromise kind of like a win win on both sides may not get everything 100% that they want, but they can get most of what they want? Would you agree to the win win? 

Tom Oldenburg, Alderman ward 16  22:11
I think that's the very definition of it. 

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  22:12
Okay. All right. Thank you for yielding. No further questions the president.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  22:17

I'm presenting this resolution to support a moratorium on new school openings. In this in the city of St. Louis until a comprehensive citywide plan for education is delivered. Whereas the population of school aged children ages five through 19 in the city of St. Louis has decreased by 18.6% between 2007 and 2018. Whereas the public school system in the city of St. Louis includes both traditional district schools and charter schools. Whereas, in 2007 through 2008, there were 103 public schools serving 60,642 children and then 2019 through 2020, there were 110 public school saving 49,939 children. Whereas the local, state, and federal support for school choice programs continue to create a system of schools and programs that fight over a declining population of children and a shrinking pool of resources, leading to the duplicated services and system wide inefficiencies. Whereas St. Louis Public Schools has closed schools and continue to face the challenge challenge of future school closures in order to best serve his current school student population and Preserve District resources to ensure the continued existence. Whereas vacant district and charter school buildings create negative impacts on our neighborhoods, and collaboration between the city schools and developers I needed to create strong communities whereas the city of St. Louis requires city wide plan by education to ensure the public school system provides a quality education for all children, regardless of their current enrollment in a district or a charter school.  Now, therefore, be it resolved that the Board of alders of the city of St. Louis supports a moratorium on new school owner than the city of St. Louis, until a comprehensive plan for education is developed. Be a further resolved that the Board of elders commit to engaging with education system leaders, education practitioners, community stakeholders, city and state level policymakers. And scholars in the development of such a plan to design a system of excellent schools, which provide consistent education opportunities across all schools, neighborhoods, and wards. A Board of all, I'm asking you to consider all of them asking for your considerable consideration for Resolution Number 45 a moratorium new school openings in the city of St. Louis, a comprehensive with a comprehensive until a comprehensive plan is developed. This will create efficiency efficient, and it will Preserve District resources. And it would serve all students, it will it will also reduce school closings. And this will improve the impact that our community will have an American and this will also help provide quality education for all students, regardless of enrollment in in district or charter school.

That was that was that was changed before I got before I got here Alderwoman Tyus. And summer, our colleagues have moved that one. But it was it's a it's a good rule, it gives you an opportunity gives the presenter an opportunity to present the resolution prior to its adoption. So Alderman from the 18th, your options will be to move to suspend the rules or purposes of moving it out today that will get you past the unanimous consent you need. You will need A two thirds majority to do that. Or you can just move we'll send it to a committee like the education committee to get give them an opportunity to review it and then it'll come out and then you can move forward from that. And that will also give you an opportunity for a longer more engaged discussion on it. So so you can do one of those things if you'd like to send it to committee just move to send resolution 65 to education and youth matters. If that would be preferable T and that and that vote would just be a simple majority. Yeah. 

Jesse Todd, 18th ward Alderman  49:41
Yeah, I'm sorry. Can, can you hear me? 

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  49:52
Yes, yes, we got. 

Jesse Todd, 18th ward Alderman  49:54
Okay. I would like to. I would like to just move it out today, Mr. President. I'd like to have voted on today. 

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  50:03
Okay, so you're gonna have to move to suspend the rules on it. So would you like to move to suspend the rules? And then we'll just open it up for discussion and come back to that. But 

Jesse Todd, 18th ward Alderman  50:15
I would like to move to suspend the rules, Mr. President, 

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  50:17
for the purposes of adopting resolution 65. Today?

Jesse Todd, 18th ward Alderman  50:22
 Yes, I would. Thank you. 

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  50:23
It's been moved by Alderman from the 18th and attained a second on that motion. 

Dwinderlin Evans, 4th ward Alderwoman  50:28
Second, 

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  50:30
second, by Alderwoman from the fourth. And there are a number of people I think, and I'm going to go down the list from where I've written them down here. I'm not sure which ones popped up first, when I looked up, there were a whole list of people, but on top of that list, Alderwoman from the 11th. 

Sarah Wood Martin, 11th ward Alderwoman  50:50
Thank you, Mr. President, I would like to request that my name be added as a sponsor. Thank you. 

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  50:55
Please make note of that. And the alderwoman from the 11th sponsor the resolution six five, Alderman from the twenty-third.

Joe Vaccaro, 23rd ward Alderman  51:04
I'm actually the opposite on it. I think that when we start trying to start a new schools charters, otherwise, ya know, private schools are still gonna be opening, I think. I realized this is a resolution doesn't really have any real effect. But I just don't see this as a unnecessary move. I think it I think it hinders us from getting schools and neighborhoods, such as charter or even public schools trying to reassess where they're at and how they open to better serve their communities. So that's all I have to say. Thank you. 

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  51:57
Alderwoman, from the 13th.

Anne Schweitzer, 13th Ward Alderwoman  51:59
Thank you so much, Mr. President, members of the board,  during the education and youth matters committee, a few. Maybe months ago, maybe last month, time is so strange. We had our chairwoman Green had Dr. Adams from the St. Louis public schools present to us. And one of the things he said during the presentation was that because of the pandemic, interestingly enough, the district and charter schools have been communicating better than ever. And this sort of, kind of butting heads of both districts and charter schools, which are both public schools, has caused a lot of contention and has been part of an unhealthy thing for our school district. And for our students more Most importantly, and what Dr. Adams said, is that they're working with the charter schools, the district and the charter schools together to put together a comprehensive plan. So I, and in that plan there, they're going to be talking about how many schools the city actually needs, and having some of these discussions that, you know, have been asked for by the people of St. Louis for so long. And this plan when it comes out, you know, will be the end of this resolution. This resolution is just saying we support this conversation that they're having, and that we're going to, as Dr. Adams has asked for, put this moratorium in place, until that that time happens. So it's not a forever thing. I believe Dr. Adams said their goal was to do it within a year. And I do think this show of solidarity that we support their planning process, and that we want this for the students of St. Louis, is a great show of solidarity from the the Board of Aldermen  as we as we look at our public schools. So I would also like to be added as a co sponsor. Thank you.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  53:51
Alderwoman, from the 13th as co sponsor, Alderman from the twenty-fourth.

Bret Narayan, 24th Ward Alderman  53:59
Thank you, Mr. President, members of the board. So I'd like to thank the Alderman from the 18th for for bringing this forward. I think it's an important discussion. I think, you know, we we agree and disagree on many, many things. Here at the board. We showed that just the other day. I think that one thing that we basically all agree on, though, is good quality education, good quality public education. Now, with that being said, I think I understand what this resolution is trying to do. But I would ask if the Alderman from the 18th may reconsider pushing it through today, so that we could have a committee hearing on it if he would assign it to the education and youth matters committee. I think we could have a more robust conversation about this issue, and really flesh out some of these issues. And I think that both members of the board and the general public may be in a better place to move forward on some of these issues. If we have a more robust conversation, so I'm not opposed to what what, I'm not opposed to this, this resolution, but I do think that we should shine a brighter light on what it's trying to do. And so for that reason alone, I would ask if the if the Alderman from the 18th may reconsider suspending the rules and putting this into committee. And with that, I'll yield. Thank you.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  55:27
We're moving further out, lay that question, Alderman from the 18th Alderman from the twenty-fourth. Ask if you would reconsider. And I saw the chairman of youth and education matters, [inaudible], have a committee here. So believe it or make it through the committee fairly quickly, it appears that the members of the education youth matter committee like to have time to really talk about this. And to raise more awareness about it, not to stop it, but to raise more with it. And that's what it appears, by some of them being asked to join as co sponsors and signaling their support. But it's ultimately up to you.

Jesse Todd, 18th ward Alderman  56:22
Mr. President, I would add Thank you came out of the youth matters committee. However, if the youth matters committee, chair and the members of the youth matters committee would like to have further discussion. Absolutely. I would love to have more discussion if they feel that it's necessary, because I don't sit on the youth matters committee. So therefore, I don't know what their opinion is. 

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  56:45
Okay. So what you would have to do is withdraw your motion to suspend the rules and just move that resolution 65 be assigned to education, youth matters. 

Jesse Todd, 18th ward Alderman  56:57
So I will withdraw my motion. Motion and have it be sent to the education and youth matters committed for further discussion.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  57:09
It's been moved by Alderman from the 18th. entertain a second on that motion again. I can a point of order. All right. All one, please.

second one by Alderman from the ninth. Any discussion all one from the six.

Christine Ingrassia, 6th ward Alderwoman  1:00:25
Thank you, Mr. President. Resolution 57 is a bit unusual in terms of practice here at the Board of Aldermen, but not something we haven't done before. We did a similar resolution before we pass final legislation on the MLS soccer stadium. And this is this is similar and that this resolution will allow one part of a chapter 100 tax incentive authorized under the state for a sales tax exemption on construction materials for Delhi star Corporation. If you're not familiar with Delhi star, they have an innovation center in a partnership with St. Louis University. They are an industry leader in protein manufacturing and culinary innovation. They also have a plant in Fayetteville, Illinois, that unfortunately burned I believe, in January or February of this year. And so they've been operating at less than ideal capacity as they try and find new space to call their manufacturing plant home. They've decided on a space in the sixth Ward that is in between Jefferson and 18th along the shoto corridor and industrial section of the sixth ward. And so this resolution again, would allow for them to get sales tax exemption on the construction materials so they can start purchasing those things. Before we come back in the summer, I'm sorry, in the fall after our summer recess. And then ideally, we will have something before you for the other parts of the chapter 100 that we can debate at that point. If for some reason the exemption or I apologize if the tax abatement pieces do not move forward in the fall. There are provisions for deli star to be required to pay back anything that has come through with their certificate of exemption. And I'm happy to take questions if any members of the board have them.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:02:27
All right. Any further discussion Any further discussion? Move the second second that we adopt resolution. VOTE BEING TAKENThere's been a request for roll call. Madam Clerk please call the roll.

Thank you, Mr. President, members, the board, two quick announcements, their sidewalk sale happening on the in the south grand business district this Saturday, we'd love to come out and show some love to our small businesses that have been hit over the pandemic. And then also, you know, through the intense storms of last weekend and know there was a lot of damage done. tower Grove Park is, I mean, they had I think 40 trees that sustained significant damage or were taken down completely, another 90 that are going to have to be taken down because of the damage. That is an immense loss to this park that is a public private partnership. And so if you are a member of our park down here, they're they're accepting donations would love to continue to support them as they do the massive work of cleanup after that incredible storm last weekend.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:09:06
Thank you. Thank you. Oh, all the way from 22nd.

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  1:09:18
Mr. President, I yield to the Alderwoman of a person to 13 Thank you. All right, perfect. Alderwoman from the first

Sharon Tyus, 1st ward Alderwoman  1:09:24
Mr. President, just a point of inquiry I've been kicked off of zoom about eight times. Got here this morning. They couldn't get on for 20 minutes. Did we do a moment of silence for for both Hazel and Betty?

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:09:39
We did Betty we did Hazel last week but okay, but all right. I just want to make sure because I couldn't I didn't know cuz I kept getting kicked off. All right, thank you for but please lead us in another for both of them. I think that'd be more than appropriate and they were both long friends of yours. So I wouldn't want to not give you that opportunity. Please do. I think all members would appreciate that.

Sharon Tyus, 1st ward Alderwoman  1:10:01
I appreciate it. They were they were both my friends. Betty was a mentor and help Hazel get elected. And one of my best remembrance of is when Betty had moved out way out almost to Barrington downs. And this was when pearl he was still alive and Ollie, and haze, we all got in a car together and I was the driver. I was the young person in that car, and drove them all out to see Betty. And we, we had a great time. And I told Benny, I love her dearly, but I don't come up to anything past a mile past the city. And that's the end for me. Okay, that's too far out for me. But they will both be greatly missed, great friends. I've lost all three of them now, Hazel, Betty and Pearlie. But I still have Alec Stewart, who is still a mentor of mine. And I just asked you all if you would please give these great ladies, Queens, people who have really cared about our community and put their whole heart and souls just a moment of silence jointly for all of them, because to lose them. So close together is a is very hurtful and sad. And I want to give condolences to both their families.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:11:08
Right? All one from first, return it over to you. We're in your hand. So you take us into the moment. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no longer Can you take us out?

Sharon Tyus, 1st ward Alderwoman  1:11:21
You know that? No, no, no, you do that I'm tearing up. So I'm seriously these were really good friends of mine. You take care of it. Mr. President,

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:11:29
please join me in the moment of silence for the loss of both of these two just icons in our city. Thank you. And Alderwoman from the first thank you so much for that for, for putting that in perspective and given us that, you know, sharing so much of yourself and, and your time with both of them. And they were awesome. And they're trailblazers, people. People look at it now and say, Man, that's a rough road, we've got glass ceiling, put yourself in their shoes when there was a real when that ceiling was much lower. And that road had no pavement or anything on it. So and there wasn't a road. So thank you for that. Alderman from the third Alderman from the twenty-second. Do you still want to hold for a minute? I had already proved to you for the first and a third time. So I don't really write because Alderwoman from the 13th.

Anne Schweitzer, 13th Ward Alderwoman  1:12:46
Thank you so much. Mr. President, members, the board, especially Alderman Boyd, thank you. So tomorrow, there is a vaccine clinic for the COVID vaccine at the Herbert Hoover Boys and Girls Club from 10am to 2pm. Just wanted to announce that I was looking at the data this morning, you know, or 45% 45.9% vaccination rate in St. Louis city. That's pretty scary to me thinking that every other person is not vaccinated in our city. That's a lot of opportunity for COVID to spread, the Delta variant seems to be more dangerous and more easily spread. So I just urge my colleagues, to urge their constituents to please get vaccinated as soon as you possibly can. This pandemic is not over and it will not be over for a long time if we don't all get vaccinated. Thank you.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:13:37
Thank you, Alderman from the twenty-fifth. Alderman from the twenty-second. You want to jump in there? Yes, sir.

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  1:13:44
Mr. President, members of board.  I just want to say I think it's a sad day in the city of St. Louis, that we cannot accomplish the task to actually pass out for board bill Number two committee subsitute as amended. The host committee did a lot of good work. I thought we were fair, were balanced. Were inclusive. During that process, of course, we got the bill, you know, pretty late. But the commitment from you and I know myself was that the bill will be passed by today. It's really unfortunate that it appeared that a sticking point in the bill came down to black folks. It came down to disagreeing with the fact that black corridors commercial corridors should be in the bill the way it was in the bill. Everybody knows that. Martin Luther King Natural Bridge, West lossnay Grant has been neglected for a tremendous amount of years. And I'm not going to apologize for inserting it in the bill. Because it's time for African American communities to have been disinvested in for a tremendously long period of time to get more than his fair share. It's really sad that power struggles and personalities pretty much prevail. I think it's shameful on the Comptroller and the mayor that it couldn't get a second, we were led to believe that people are gonna die and the sky was gonna fall if the bill wasn't passed by June 30. Because there are a lot of people who will suffer and be evicted because of the moratorium. We were blessed with the fact that the President extended the moratorium to July 31. So I'm curious as to when people die. will people be kicked out of their homes because we didn't do our jobs because he in a basically didn't do his job because the board Obama did his job. But he and they did not do his job as a collective body. And that's troubling to me. So it leads me to believe that we were just tricked. All this hysteria about people were going to be evicted and thrown out on the streets and people need this money right away. It really wasn't that important, because what it seems as as important is personalities, Petty politics. I looked at you today in NA, and I will tell you, I always tell everybody, I'm kind of a crap house lawyer. But I think you held your ground. And you did a good job, cross examining our interim city councillor Matt mode, because Matt Moe had to clearly say the board bill was not illegal. Now, of course, he was supposed to say, but it's not really written in a way that puts us in the best position. But at the end of the day, the outcry was the boy and Bill was illegal. And so DNA shouldn't vote for because it's an illegal bill. The bill was not any legal bill. Unfortunately, this is political posturing that's going on. And it's very unfortunate, because people in our city as a whole, not just black folks are going to lose out. Because we lacked leadership from the Comptroller's office in the mayor's office to do the right thing to day. All right, thank you.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:17:06
Thank you. I just don't want to get you know, I,

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  1:17:12
well, I'm, I'm just I just want to say I'm frustrated. I feel tricked. We committed that this board bill be passed today. We did our job. We did our two jobs because the sky was gonna fall. And I guess the sky is not gonna file. So shame on DNA. Thank you.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:17:27
Thank you, alderman. Thank you so much, Bobby from 22nd. All the way down from 26.

Shameem Clark-Hubbard, 26th ward Alderwoman 26  1:17:33
Thank you, Mr. President. Can you hear me? Yes. Okay. Thank you, Mr. President, members of the board. I have a couple of announcements. First, I want to make sure everyone is familiar with prepare SEO and this weekend starting yesterday, they're having their living wills summit. This virtual and in person a couple of in person events you can go to prepare SEO comm and sign up is everything is free. They also have childcare and things available. So again, this is a good thing for us to pass on to our constituency because of course their motto I love their motto is to prepare and prevail. And this is prepare SEO and the regional response team to the toast our COVID-19 pandemic which is the Alderwoman from the 13th just pointed out we are still going through. And then I also want to share this announcement with my colleagues from the 28th out alone Navarro at Forest Park. I'm just a proud I guess neighbor, that pure catering that I've talked about a lot this house and the 26th Ward has taken over the cafe and the Missouri History Museum on the 28th Ward and they have a Sunday brunch. That's an amazing brunch, but it also includes live music and so on this Sunday is going to have to wild Rice is the shift and Antwan is the saxophone playing Scrabble if you get a chance and if you can't make it this Sunday, it's every Sunday this month but this Sunday from 11 to three of the Missouri hits museum cafe St. Louis by pure catering SEO was having their brunch they'll

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:19:01
join me Thank you Alderwoman from the 19th

Marlene Davis, Alderwoman ward 19  1:19:09
Thank you Mr. President, members of the board. I had I needed to say something and I've shared with some of my colleagues this morning. And and I think that I should share with everybody. I so appreciated the work that was done as a collective body on board bill number two is show that we had the the wheel and the determination to make sure that not only the that there was given take, but that we got our job done and it didn't matter that it was 12 hours. It we all should be proud because you show this at how to get the work done. And there was a lot of debate, you send a good deal over. We all know that if there's something that we need to do differently and or change in the near future in order to support a process or procedure that could be done. But we know there was a lot in that bill, that should be moving forward on Monday morning, to help the constituents of the city of St. Louis. But I just wanted to say thank you to every older person, because that was a good experience. And I tell you, I've started on a mini board, not just locally, but all over this nation. And that was a good experience. And I think you all should be proud. And if you don't mind, Mr. President, could I please take another two minutes a minute of privilege, because most people don't understand that. Betty Thompson was a mentor to all of us. She was my first supervisor. In the work study program when I was 14 years old. That's where I first learned about how to serve people. Because she taught you how to respect people, how to give deference to those who were under distress when they came in looking for services. I learned a lot and I followed her all my life and asked questions and asked for help. So I just wanted to say I'm going to miss her, her whole family or service oriented entire family. And so I wanted to give my condolences again. And most especially all the respect for all this Shige to this earth. Thank

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:21:42

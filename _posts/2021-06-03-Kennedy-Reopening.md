Terry Kennedy, Board of Alderman Clerk: Many of the staff was initially feeling that waiting until September would be the best way to go now. Now, Why? There are a number of things that not only the safety issue, you have to keep in mind that the full staff is not up and running. We're short at least three people. And the staff is doing more than we've seen in the past. We're creating minutes and agendas for every meeting, for the committee meetings. It is a lot more work. 

So what they many felt was that giving it that time also does not rushes into something that could end up being unsafe and Helter Skelter. That's really what I hope I made some sense with that.

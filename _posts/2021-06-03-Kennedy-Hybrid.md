Terry Kennedy, Board of Alderman Clerk: Then there were numerous recommendations to continue the virtual meetings for the committee's, or some hybrid type of meeting where you might be able to do a combination of a virtual aspect and in person aspect. I did speak to the communications division about that and they are not prepared or set up or I have the equipment for that yet. So that having a hybrid meeting is not really an option at this point. But it may be in some future rendition.

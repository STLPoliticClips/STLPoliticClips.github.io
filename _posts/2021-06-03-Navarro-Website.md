Heather Navarro, Alderwoman ward 28: Not looking at all the other reasons why somebody might not want to apply for a job in the City of St. Louis, that's not on you also to figure that out. But this piece here of what happens when How does somebody actually get into the system? I think that there are a lot of easy things there that still need to be addressed. Because even if somebody wants to, --- I couldn't even do it myself right now. I had somebody else, somebody else just texted me and said “Yeah, I just checked too” and I couldn't actually click on any of those buttons to apply for any of those different positions.

So and what are we doing in terms of recruitment? I mean, what in this budget is about either job fairs or outreach? And then I think also upgrading the website, I think something has got to happen with how do people what's their first interaction with the city in terms of applying for a job. If they start, you know, maybe they're getting an application handed to them from somebody, but if they are going to the website, which is I think, where most people are going to go? 

How do we get over these barriers, just so that they can apply for a job? I mean, if their first interaction is, is that sort of bumps in the road.. They are going to ..

Linda Thomas, Dept. of Personnel: Sorry.

Ald. Heather Navarro: That's okay. So I guess my question here is, there's a bunch of different pieces here. One is just a communication issue. It sounds like between the departments and the personnel office, because we've been hearing it all, you know, for weeks now from the various departments that they're stuck, because they can't get through personnel. And I hear you saying that, well, you know, we hold on until we get six candidates, and by then maybe they've lost somebody. So it's not working, whatever we are doing is just fundamentally not working. 

I don't think just pointing the fingers at crime and residency. Yes, those are issues and there are other departments working on that. But what are we doing to improve the functions of this department, from the website to job fairs, to outreach and communication?

Linda Thomas, Dept. of Personnel:  Well, actually, you heard Cindy speak about the new computer system that she's working on. I've been intimately involved in that for months. Now, our current website was not developed by us, it was developed by someone from IT naturally because we're not computer whizzes here by any means. I'm lucky I know how to turn one on. 

But I mean, your points are well taken.

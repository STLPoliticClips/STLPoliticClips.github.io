Annie Rice 7:17 I'm excited to pass out this immediate direct aid that our our citizens have been asking for and the amount of money in here that is going to directly help people and their families as they're struggling as we have the threat of the eviction or the end of the eviction moratorium. And thankfully, we stayed for a little bit, but we have time to get that money out to people who need it. We have the vaccination, mobile vaccination clinics, we've got all sorts of incredible direct cash relief, that is getting out. And I'm thrilled about that. And thrilled to watch the, you know, the $500 cash payments get out. I'm so just want to thank everybody for that work. I I was a bit frustrated on our last meeting. I know it was 10 hours long. And but there were some other amendments that we were really hoping to discuss in front of the full board. And you know that I think it was a missed opportunity to have that discussion as as full board members about where were we really came together on some of those things, and maybe where we still continue to differ.

I also remain concerned about the Treasury and the possibility of provoking an audit or a clawback. We do have incredible infrastructure money coming down with the senate passing the infrastructure bill and the bill back better grants. I think there's a lot of money coming down the pike, that is going to be going specifically for economic development. I'm thrilled about all of those things. I think the city of St. Louis, and our citizens have a real I mean, real promise on the horizon. And if we use this money correctly, we get this money to the people to use correctly. And so I remain concerned, I think the points in a meeting have given me a significant pause about each element of this bill. And I, I worry a little bit about, about the precedent that we're setting. If we've, if we've been told no, but we're going ahead. So I think I think as I said, I'm excited to see more development money coming down the pike. And hopefully, we can, we can use that in a way to address the concerns of long-neglected and intentionally neglected neighborhoods, in our city.

Jack Coatar 13:38: Thank you, Mr. President, members of the board. I'm glad that people have put their disagreements aside and that we're gonna stop playing politics and finally pass this direct aid in board bill two, anyone who's who's been downtown and seen some of the encampments, you know, knows that the kind of crisis we're facing, and then the relief that's desperately needed for our unhoused and for others. So I'm glad we're doing this. There's obviously still a lot of money that needs to be appropriated in this first tranche that we've received from the Treasury. 

And it's my hope that this process, you know, room 200, in the mayor's office is realized, you know, we've got to be part of this process. I'm all for all the public engagement in the world set up citizen committees take their input, but you've got to include the board, you got to include board members, and your spending plans because frankly, at the end of the day, it's got to come through this body and it's got to be appropriated by us.

Joe Vaccaro 15:01 Yes, just real very quickly talking about shots in arms. If you have someone that is homebound the--- if you call the health department, I went through this with the fire chief Dennis Dickerson, they will go to homebound people's home and give them their shot in their house. So if you have some homebound you call the health department. And they have the fire department and the EMS or the paramedics go out, and they're actually doing shots for homebound. So I was unaware of it. Someone asked me if they could get a shot in their house. They call the fire chief? And he said yes. [cuts out] the process.

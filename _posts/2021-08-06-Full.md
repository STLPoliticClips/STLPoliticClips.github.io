move for adoption items one and two is printed on the agenda.

Darlene Green, Comptroller  1:37  
Move to second floor with discussion. Thank you.

Tishaura O. Jones, Mayor  1:43  
I would like to amend item number one. To add the following contract from the Department of Health you should have received the contract and an email from my office at approximately 1130. This contract is with affinia health care through the St. Louis Department of Health communicable diseases division in the amount of $500,000 to perform COVID-19 vaccinations and testing at Papa clinics throughout the city. This contract is funded out of fun 1410 center 1422037 account 5367. Just to give an overview of that contract, we're contracting with entities like afinia to expand our capacity to stand up pop up vaccination clinics throughout the city, partnering with the Urban League horizon, the United Way and doorways to expand our capacity to disburse rental assistance directly to tenants in a timely fashion and working with legal services of Eastern Missouri or EOC and the conflict resolution center to provide legal and mediation services to individuals on the eviction docket.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  2:52  
Second,

Tishaura O. Jones, Mayor  2:54  
moved and properly seconded. Is there any discussion? As Seeing none. I miss Green, please call the roll up I'm sorry. 

Before we move forward, I'd also like to talk a little bit about board bill two. to just briefly review the process that brought us here. 

Since I took office, I've been pushing for COVID-19 relief for St. Louis families getting shots and arms, keeping families in their homes and improving public safety. The $80 million Direct Relief package which was a product of community and data driven processes informed by public input by over 2,500 responses, received overwhelming support at the Board of Alderman public hearings it directs over $15 million to the Department of Health funds a robust $40 million safety net for families and those at risk of eviction and invest in youth programming and jobs $500 direct payments, community violence intervention, public Wi Fi and more. The Board of Aldermen took public comment on our plan, and almost every speaker asked him to pass the Direct Relief package as soon as possible. So 

I also have to note here that there are substantive disagreements with this proposal, which are neither comprehensive nor innovative, and have designed to meet the needs of developers not working families. When I'm talking about the economic development piece of this proposal. federal guidelines clearly provide that the American rescue plan Act funds may not be used for economic development. There are some limited exceptions, affordable housing, workforce development facade improvements and technical assistance for small businesses and, and prospective entrepreneurs but the incentives to subsidize develop developer construction cost detailed and President reads amendment are clearly in an ineligible expense. 

The Biden administration's guiding principle is simple. These dollars are meant for public good, not private profit. We propose multiple fixes to the language that will follow US Treasury regulations, and actually put more money in some more areas of North St. Louis, our executive director of sldc, Neal Richardson sent the Board of Aldermen a letter detailing the flaws in the approach and included two amendments to correct them. They have been ignored.

 And, and and there was board and the board was forced to vote prematurely and and debate and shut down and Alderwoman trying to do reintroduced the amendment. Let me make this clear. I grew up in and still live in North St. Louis. So I could not be more aligned with the president stated stated intent. 

But I also understand that people come before buildings, and that dispersing Direct Relief to families in crisis is the best way is the best thing we can do to strengthen the local economy. These funds will be subject to immense federal scrutiny. And when auditors find that we've allocated funds for development incentives, we will be required to pay it back. 

This makes St Louis vulnerable unless we can unwind these redevelopment agreements. The costs will ultimately be borne by our general fund, which is already stretched thin by the city's operational commitments, and should not be used to allocate

to allocate to private private for profit corporations. We tried and over and over again, to work with President Reid and his refusal to bring this legislation in line with federal guidelines on spending. ARPA money has delayed COVID-19 resources, direct assistance, and more from getting to families who needed the most. When you spend federal money, you follow federal rules. But President Reed refused to listen to the city councilor CARES and ARPA compliance accountants hired by the Krewson administration or the St. Louis Development Corporation tasked with administering these funds. I ran on reversing decades of disinvestment in North St. Louis. And I'll continue to ensure that we seize this once in a generation opportunity to transform an inequitable and unsustainable status quo with expenditures in line with federal rules. I'm committed to sending hundreds of millions of dollars to North St. Louis in parts of South St. Louis. But the truth is that revitalizing the Northside will take billions of dollars and we have to be strategic. We can't afford to rush $70 million out of the door. As president Reid suggests, those dollars will leave our communities leave our communities as fast as they came in. We cannot just subsidize developers we need to invest, invest in workforce development, affordable housing, public transit, roads, streetlights, demolitions, and repairs, and neighborhood planning and local anchors like schools and community centers. We need a real plan to leverage these funds for maximum impact, and my development agencies are on the job. SLDC is working on an economic justice action plan to strategically invest federal funds. The Affordable Housing Commission and Community Development Administration are drafting an affordable housing strategy. Slate is expanding its offerings and key clusters poised for job growth. And the planning department is ramping up its investment in inclusive neighborhood planning to ensure that funds are spent in line with the community's vision. St. Louis is at a crossroads. Deep racial inequities, compounded by an unprecedented pandemic, economic recession and a wave of violence have pushed families across our city to the brink. We need to make bold investments designed to chart a new course towards justice, equity, and democracy. Just as we intentionally invested in the central corridor for the last 50 years, we must use Recovery Act dollars to breathe new life into North St. Louis and to parts of South St. Louis. We need to be innovative and strategic. Because business as usual just doesn't cut it. So I'm proud that the vast majority of my claim made it into this final bill alongside important additions like increased funding to expand voting rights and vaccination incentives. In fact, the only cuts the board make was made was to administrative funding essentially telling us we love your ideas, but we won't fund you to administer them. I'm proud of the work that my administration has done to bring the public into this process and put together a comprehensive relief package. 

I'm proud of how faith labor and community leaders came together to save the $500 direct payments for 1000s of St. Louisians after President Reed stripped them from the bill. Let me say this. President Reid showed the same zeal for researching US Treasury rules as he did for taking $500 payments away from St. Louis families, families would have relief by now. And though I hope that the President might take the responsible route and amend his bill, in order to ensure that we don't lose federal funds, the truth is that St. Louis residents cannot wait. President Reid has told us that he won't change a single period on this bill. This puts our city in a very vulnerable position. But we can't let political games slow us down any further, we need to move forward. And so today in the best interest of the city, and residents, I'll be voting to pass for Bill two out of the board of Estimate and Apportionment. 

But before we do, I want invited Jim Brown one of our federal lobbyists to talk more about the economic development provisions of this bill and why it's flawed, Jim.

Jim Brown, DC Lobbyist for City  11:08  
Okay, thank you merit. And it's really a great opportunity to give you an update. And it's good to see you president read and Comptroller Green. And what I'd like to do is just mention economic development on a little broader plane so that you have an idea of what's coming your way, which is very, very exciting. The End, I'll give you a treasury update on rule 2.8 regarding economic development right after that. The first one is is that EDA just announced for the first time a billion dollar new build back better economic development grant for 30 projects ranging from 25 million to over 100 million. And the city is going to be competing for these funds. They get at the economic development that is referred to in in in the board bill at the moment that would not be allowed by Treasury. It has many opportunities along those lines, we also have a great opportunity and that in February, President Biden passed a new executive order, which was tougher than the Obama executive order, I would say that federal funds going must be prioritized for neighborhoods that are under economic stress. So I think our application we send it in is going to be very well received. The The second item is that we are about to see the largest economic development shot in the arm and infrastructure of since the Eisenhower interstate highway with the passage tomorrow by the Senate. The latest is they're going to pass it tomorrow find me that it will go to the house of the infrastructure bill and that bill is loaded with economic development opportunities that St. Louis will be able to capitalize on. I can I can run through the details if there's any questions but from from repairing streets overpasses, getting led out of the residential pipes, to broadband, on and on, and on and on. And these will all provide key things that you've got to do. When you're reviving a corridor or a neighborhood, you've got to fix the streets, you have to be able to allow these people to get broadband, you have to make sure they're not drinking lead out of their pipes. So this is all related to economic development. The third thing quickly is that we are about to see the largest infrastructure bill and and in history from what I can see involving human infrastructure. And that's the bill you keep hearing about that is going to be taken up by the House and Senate right after. While right after the senate passes the infrastructure bill. Mr. Schumer has announced majority that is Schumer has announced that they're going to go right away to the reconciliation bill which, which is just a it's kind of an unusual term for meeting that you only need 51 votes to pass a bill you do not need 60 votes. So this is how the republicans passed the tax bill three years ago and so on. So that bill is also going to be its human infrastructure. But it's still very important infrastructure dealing with child care, elder care, eldercare, Junior College, and so forth. So it It also is infrastructure. Now let me go straight to where we are. With Treasury at this point, the interim final rule and that's what it's called interim final rule from Treasury on the on ways that you can use the American Recovery Act is the final it's basically what everyone is using to govern the judgment They make at this point, there will be a final final rule sometime this fall. But cities all over the United States are getting this money out the door right now, based on this interim final rule. 

There is no indication whatsoever that the 2.8 as its referred to governing, the use of economic development opportunities for these funds is going to be changed. It's very unlikely that they are going to change the parameter of the existing rule. Specifically, it says on Page 26788, eligible uses uses "may recipients use funds for general economic development period. Answer, no." It's it goes on receipts, "recipients must demonstrate that the funding is for economic impact of covid 19, of the COVID-19 related emergency only." And that covers a huge area of all the other things that are in board bill two, and so on. 

So given these other economic activities that are coming your way, and they're great opportunities, and I think in addition to this 500 million, we are we will be the beneficiaries of some of this new money coming down the pike.

My recommendation would be to precedent read to defer defer now and take this section, six out. And here's here's the thing I'm getting at is that if Treasury shut down the road change, to point a, to somehow widen economic development, you're going to have two or three or four more board bills getting all this 500 million out over the next two years. So there will be other opportunities to discuss this issue down the road. But I don't think the Treasury is going to change that rule. 

I would close out by saying that. I've been up here for 40 years representing you all, Mayor Jones is my seventh mayor. And I have seen and worked with a lot of federal agencies. And I want to tell you, there's one agency up here You do not want to mess with. And that's Treasury. And there are going to be audits on this bill. Excuse me, not on this bill. But there will be audits on the American Recovery Act and this 500 million that we received, and the 65 billion that other cities are receiving all across the country, there's going to be audits that may not be in 21. But there'll be in 22, and 23 and 24. And the one thing you the city does not want to trigger is a clawback. And they have made callbacks many times on different programs and all these different federal agencies. And if you know if they get a clawback through an audit in three years, where are you going to find that money, you're going to have to go pull it back from something else or take it out of general revenues. 

The final thing is that the League of Cities and the Conference of Mayors has been pleading with mayors and Mayor Jones has been on many of these zooms with Tom Cochran, the President, please stay within the Treasury guidelines. The Republicans who fought cities getting direct economic aid, they're just waiting to be able to jump on some city and say, See, you know, they're already abusing the rules that Treasury put out. And you don't want that to happen. It's It's It's not what we want. And it would be, you know, advisable. I think, to get this, the rest of the great funds that are that the mayor and President Reid have proposed in this bill, get that money out on the street, where it's desperately needed right now. And, and see what opportunities we get from these other economic development opportunities that I just outlined in the beginning here. Because this is a lot of money for us to go after you've got a great economic team in place will be highly competitive. And I think we have a good chance of capitalizing on these funds, and I'm happy to take any questions.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  19:39  
Are there any questions for Mr. Brown? Oh, absolutely. Absolutely. First, thanks, Madam Mayor, for your opening and thank you also, Mr. Brown. I have a lot of questions. First of which have you reviewed section 3.8 of our guidelines. section one, I'm sorry, but it looks like your videos frozen. Section. Section three, I think it's three that eight, or just to make it a little more broad. The section covering lost revenue. Yes, I have. Okay. And do you have that? Where you can read it? No,

Jim Brown, DC Lobbyist for City  20:33  
I don't. But I can tell you very exactly that that loss revenue would not translate into the economic development that you're proposing. It's,

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  20:47  
by the way, have you? Do you have the board bill in front of you?

Jim Brown, DC Lobbyist for City  20:51  
Well, I have I have section six.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  20:56  
And what the section six a it says economic empowerment, because you continue to quote, economic development, but the board believes economic empowerment. Right? Do you have that with? Yes, I do. Alright, so I guess my question is, why do you continue to refer to it as economic development when we are talking about economic empowerment? And what would be the difference in given us small business support in North St. Louis, where that small business would help people who have been displaced by COVID by giving them new job training skills, by working to get them back in the work place? By helping them? You know, you know, get access to see settings, whatever that business would be? How would that not fit the ARPA guidelines, but then it would be okay to give a small business, a loan in downtown St. Louis? Well,

Jim Brown, DC Lobbyist for City  21:59  
the way I would answer that, is that economic empowerment, the benefit economic empowerment. You do that with many other parts of your bill?

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  22:11  
Well, no, I'm second, I asked specifically. Why would it be a problem to give funds in North St. Louis, in a qualified census tract, when those exact kind of funds are being given out in other parts of the city. So if it's against our rules to give economic development funds to people in North St. Louis, it shouldn't be against the rules to give the same money to the people in downtown and other parts of the city. It doesn't matter that it's an it doesn't matter that we have other pools of funds that are like funds and other parts of the bill. Because by saying that you prove my point exactly. Not well, we jump in on this gym because, you know, Mr. Pfeffer? I'm not I'm not asking you a question. I'm asking the question from the person who who made the presentation. Okay,

Jim Brown, DC Lobbyist for City  23:09  
let me let me reply. First of all rules had governed other federal funding that we would get are totally, totally different from the rule. What's

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  23:17  
the difference and given a small business, a loan of given a small business, small business development funds, in a qualified census tract in North St. Louis, versus given that same money to a business in downtown? 

Jim Brown, DC Lobbyist for City  23:32  
Well, the way I'm reading section six here, you're talking about identifying Carter's several pairs,

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  23:41  
why is that a problem?

Jim Brown, DC Lobbyist for City  23:44  
You're not going to develop you're not going to develop corridoors without involving developers and with

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  23:51  
no okay. Okay. Let me ask the question. So if indeed you you put money out solid as qualified census tracts and you go downtown and give a small business development loan or small business loan to a business downtown? Those funds would be okay but the funds in North St. Louis le qualified since attract wouldn't be okay.

Jim Brown, DC Lobbyist for City  24:15  
Right. Let me give you this okay. This is straight from the White House factsheet. This this American rescue plan money was designed for one support urgent COVID-19 response efforts to continue to decrease the spread and virus and bring the pandemic under control to replace loss public sector revenue to strengthen support for vital public services and help retain jobs three support immediate economic stabilization for households for adjust this systematic public health and economic challenges that have contributed to the n equal impact of the pandemic on certain populations. It does not call for the time of economic development that's in your bill.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  25:00  
You continue to skip over the fact that the lost revenue section of the ARPA funds give broad powers or broad latitude to municipalities. And the reason it does that, and if you remember what President Biden said, when they were releasing these funds, he talked about the importance of going into areas that have been economically depressed, prior to call it because the recovery in those areas would be a much steeper recovery and a much longer recovery. And then porns, of putting those dollars to work to stabilize those areas. Like you see the mayor of Detroit doing right, the mayor of Detroit have identified seven different areas, just like we've done here in this board bill is doing the exact same thing. The mirror of Pennsylvania pa exact same thing. There is no difference in these slots. Did you get a chance to read the auditor's letter that we received from the city's accounting agency concerning the board bill? No, I haven't seen that. Okay, you may want to take a look at that. That'd be a very important thing that you take a look at it. Because what the auditor what the auditor says otter there that that has been hired by us to, you know, look at and review these documents and make sure that we stay with them for guidelines, they say that, that although the board bill itself would not trigger what you've just come on here and stated. It would be a good practice for the city to include in every section of any board bill. References that we have within our board bill where we say that the funds and close within must adhere to our guidelines. And I'll ask you this next question. Can you can you explain to me how the how the the appropriations process because you understand that on appropriations is merely the authorization of spend and it does not require spending? It does not, you know, for spin and after the appropriations process, what happens is that the department and the department heads through the consulting funds that are put in the bill, working with our accountants working with our our consoling agencies, they formulate the final program that includes, you know, application process, the approval process reporting everything that happens centered around that. So, how can how can you? How can you have a clawback on funds that have not been spent back on funds that would have to be authorized, and, and, you know, approved through a process that's put together after the bill.

Jim Brown, DC Lobbyist for City  28:26  
The appropriators  are what Treasury goes by, the appropriators...

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  28:33  
You're the first one to say that they,

Jim Brown, DC Lobbyist for City  28:35  
yes, the appropriaters for the ones that they express the city's intent. And Treasury is basically saying that in this particular case, or what they would say is that it was the intent of the city to expand these funds for economic development purposes that were not allowed in the rules. And then what happens in terms of implementation is is a whole nother story. And most of them, they would base the audit on the intent, which is the appropriations.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  29:06  
Mr. Brown I'm I'm sorry, that that that is one of the most outrageous statements I've ever heard. So you're saying that that that the that the federal government would clawback funds based on your intent and not what you finally spent the funds on and the process and the authorization and the reviews that happened during that process? That's what you're saying that 

Jim Brown, DC Lobbyist for City  29:35  
what they do 

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  29:36  
you're gonna have to show me that that that's the most outrageous thing I've ever heard.

Jim Brown, DC Lobbyist for City  29:41  
By your by your board bill, you are sending a signal that you are not following the Treasury guidance and that by itself will trigger could possibly trigger a review. 

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  29:52  
You know, I have, we have our attorney on here, Mr. Elton Kistner and also by I just want to...

Tishaura O. Jones, Mayor  30:02  
Lewis. Elkin Kistner is not a contractor of the city of St. Louis.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  30:07  
He is an authorized contractor of the city of St. Louis, 

Tishaura O. Jones, Mayor  30:10  
Was that contract brought before E and A? 

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  30:13  
No I'm paying, I'm paying elkon. I'm raising money and also paying elkin. Personally if I have to, to get this thing moving, because it's that important for the city of St. Louis, that we cut through the politics. So that's why we're here.

Tishaura O. Jones, Mayor  30:26  
I'm asking because, you know, as, as mayor, I'm not sure if this is appropriate. Comptroller Green?

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  30:33  
that's okay. I don't, we

Darlene Green, Comptroller  30:35  
It is not approriate to have a member from outside of E&A. We can enter into a vote. However, if we would like to hear from someone who is not a member of na, we have agreed to hear from Jim Brown. Now, Mr. President Reed, if you understand the rules, we cannot have you as one member of E and A, to bring on someone that has not been agreed to.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  31:07  
I agree with that. 

Madam Comptroller. I agree with that assessment. I wish I would have known that. There was going to be that there was an agreement to bring Mr. Jim Brown on I had no idea until he was just introduced a second ago. So I guess I was the only member of the board of VNA that that was left out of those discussions. But I agree. And I will, and I'll honor that. But if y'all have any questions of delkin, he is on the call. And and if you decide, you know, collectively want to hear from you can. So I'll just continue my questions. To to Jim Brown, because he's, Jim is saying some things that we have not heard from the city councilor. We have not heard from any consultant related to this, the National Association of ministers and the National Association of Counties, if you have you had an opportunity to take a look at their report.

Jim Brown, DC Lobbyist for City  32:12  
Yes, I have. And the conference of mayors and League of Cities is those are the two organizations that we generally consult with on things like this. But we also have a great deal of respect for the Department of Treasury attorneys, and auditors. And when they go to the lengths that they did to produce this rule, most cities are following what Treasury is giving.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  32:39  
And with all due respect, Mr. Brown we are to, you know, and also understand that, you know, I also understand that you're in a tough position now with your contract being currently reviewed by the administration, and whether they're going to continue to utilize you move forward. Here's what I'm happy about. And, you know, look, I'm, I'm just thankful that that we are going to move barbell to I think the more important thing is that we work to get these funds out to people is obvious that that every section within the board bill is legal and compliant. It's clear and should be clear that for anybody who's ever gotten a grant federal funding or anything in income matter, and, you know, haven't been the longest seat at president board, while I'm in the history of city and having carried more appropriations bills, probably than any body in the legislative branch in the history of our city. I'm well, we're aware of how these things work. We just did over $140 million under the previous administration. And I know what happens after we pass this. And I have all the confidence in the world and the mayor's office and her administration, to assure that when they enter into the agreements with the consultants, that those consultants will, will assure, just like in the previous administration, that the process for approval, the process for review, and all of the checks and balances and reporting is in place. A an appropriations bill does not do that. That's part of what happens after an appropriations bill. You can ask, discuss this with any municipality in the country. And appropriations bill is the authorization. What happens after authorization and the process you go through after the authorization And the reporting is was absolutely key. I think it's absolutely essential that we get funding in place for these businesses and, and residents in the north side. And again, I repeat, if, indeed, it's okay to spend money in downtown and central corridor and south side, that same funding should be available to businesses and communities. North of Delmar. And, again, like I said, I have every confidence that that, you know, upon the final passage of board bill number two, we're ultimate wall of us ultimately will be on the same Page. And I'm looking forward to getting to work on the next package, because, you know, we got to get this one out of the way so we can get to work on the next packet. So Madam Mayor, Madam Comptroller, I want to just thank you both in advance for work into to move this thing. And, and also want to thank our attorney, elkind, kisner, for his findings, and also restating the position of the city councilor who said that the bill was, was a legal bill. And, again, this is an appropriations bill. So thanks, everyone, for Forgive me for giving me an opportunity to talk. And I look forward to working through this bill, and also the next one.

Jim Brown, DC Lobbyist for City  36:38  
Mayor, I would just like to make one summary comment, and I respect president Reid's view, I would just reiterate the fact that it would, in my judgment, it would be very fool foolish to challenge the US Treasury at this point with their guidance and their, their rulemaking. And I think that if this stays in this bill, I think we are inviting an audit. And I think we're inviting a possible callback and funds that maybe not in 2021. But in later years. And I will just say one final thing that that

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  37:19  
mountain layer framework, if you will, I think you know, we have we're having this home circuit, we're happy. We're having this. We're having this. It's not finished talking. It would have been nice to know that Mr. Brown was gonna be here today. All right. Can you remember the deal that he was gonna

Unknown Speaker  37:45  
president re Can you let Mr. Brown finish so we can get on? I will allow. I will allow him to finish. But go ahead. Thank you.

Jim Brown, DC Lobbyist for City  37:53  
Well, thank and I'll summarize real quickly. All I can tell you, in addition to what I've already said, is that on numerous zoom meetings with the Conference of Mayors League of Cities, which we do weekly, these rules come up. And everyone that I know of and and the other 600 members of the Conference of Mayors is following these Treasury guidelines to the tee, and they are not taking this kind of risk. But I wish you luck with this. And if I can be of any further assistance and answer any questions, I'm happy to do so.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  38:30  
No, man, I have a question. Since we're going to continue down this line, this line of discussion. Mr. Brown what is disallowed under loss revenue? If you want me to help you, I will. Do you want me to go over the things that are disallowed?

Tishaura O. Jones, Mayor  38:58  
President re Do you want to vote this bill out? Or do you want to, I want to vote the bill out. But we continue to go much further and I ready whenever you are.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  39:07  
Alright. Let's just let's just let's leave in our issue. Our issue, our show a statement to the to Mr. Brown on some outrageous claims that were made here today. And again, I think both of you all for your support today in working through this so that we can get on with the next bill. Thank you both.

Tishaura O. Jones, Mayor  39:29

Christine Ingrassia, Alderwoman ward 6: Okay I'm hoping you read a little bit further in the code and went to chapter 3 section 98.010, which articulates how public services contracts are to be entered. Are you aware of who has the authority to enter into those contracts and how that process works?

Tom Oldenburg, Alderman ward 16: I am aware of that and I guess my answer is, I’m pushing the envelope on that. Let’s send a message here.

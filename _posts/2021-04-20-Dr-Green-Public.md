Dr. Megan Green, Alderwoman 15th ward: Weâ€™ve had a number of contentious bills over the year here too. Civilian Oversight is one, minimum wage is another, where we knew that we really needed public testimony because there were a lot of raw emotions around both of these bills. 

So we took it upon ourselves to have, I think, three or four public hearings where we had fifty, sixty, people show up to each one of those hearings. We made time for it and we made it a priority, because it was important. 

I think if folks take time to come down to city hall or to contact us online to say that they want to testify on something via Zoom, whether it is a tax abatement that is occurring in their wards or something very controversial like criminal justice reform, we owe it to folks to hear what they have to say.

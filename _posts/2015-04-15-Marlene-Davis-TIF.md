Marlene Davis, Alderwoman 19th ward: I am definitely, oh lord just control my words right now. Cause right now I’m a little pissed, and I’ma tell you why.

Even though I have supported alderpersons in their wards and what they need or want to do. You have always been very clear of my position about the developer of Northside Generation [sic] because I never believed that he was going to ever do anything, I never believed that he was financially strapped. I never believed that he even understood what he was doing.

I have said that over and over again. But at the end of the day, when information is kept from us, that’s a huge problem. 

We’re sitting here supporting legislation, and we don’t have all the information. I can’t live with that.

At the end of the day, I know what’s going to happen. The public is going to come after all of us. That’s what gonna happen. You can’t just let something just sit forever and hope and pray and maybe, that’s not how you operate a business. You don’t do it like that. I’ve said that as well. We should have called the TIF in awhile ago. We should have a hearing on the TIF. I’ve said that. 

See I don’t have friends when it comes to business, cause that’s business. We’re not handling our business right. Now, I don’t know what we can do as a committee. Maybe that’s something else we can look into. But, I know the public is gonna come for us. There’s no if and buts about it. Then to have a statement out there, that I already knew about his financial situation, when you were about to prove a TIF and I didn’t tell you? Oh come on now. 

We might as well be living in a different country. This is not how it should be operating on any level of government. I’m gonna try not to get myself over involved in this, but I wanted to let everybody know that I don’t like it.

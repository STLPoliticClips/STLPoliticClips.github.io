James Page, 5th ward Alderman  00:00
Use pickup on a regular basis. So it doesn't end up a literal garbage dump. It happens every time. So I'm gonna ask the Alderwoman from the six, to tell me anything she can to inspire confidence that these intentional encampments, how at home colonies, tiny home, villages, will be managed in an orderly, sanitary manner, so that they do not degrade the safety and quality of life of the surrounding neighborhoods. With that, I will yield for answers.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  00:43
Thank you so much. For a second alderman from the fifth, would you like to all the one from the 60 yield for questioning? Because otherwise, I'll have to go to the next people on the list. And we'll get back to her shortly.

James Page, 5th ward Alderman  01:00
Yes, I provided questions. And Can she answer them now without additional procedure, 

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  01:06
yet? Well, what you'll have to do is ask her to yield for questions. And then that way I can give her an opportunity to talk.

James Page, 5th ward Alderman  01:13
Then I will ask the Alderwoman. From the six to yield for questions

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  01:19
I want from six will yield for questions and all the men from the fifth.

Christine Ingrassia, 6th ward Alderwoman  01:23
Absolutely. And thank you

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  01:24
so much. Please proceed with your questions.

Christine Ingrassia, 6th ward Alderwoman  01:30
All the way from the fifth. okay with you. I'll proceed I I heard your questions. I think they are smart. And I appreciate the level of detail with which you are wanting to interact. Once again, I will I will just provide that if you are supportive of any home project, then you are suppose supportive of intentional encampments or Tiny Homes. For the remainder of the city, they provide 24 hour wraparound services seven days a week, which is security and community outreach for support services, food and hygiene kits. employment support, I mean just a wide variety of services that are not being offered in I think encampments that we're all use to kind of being a part of in terms of like being on the news or being controversial.  What we keep doing in the city of St. Louis is chasing these folks around in a really degrading and obnoxious way. from place to place to place I have been on the ground. And again, pardon me for not being as involved in the unhoused situation as I needed to be as an elected official time. But since March of 2020, I have been on the ground, if not daily, weekly, or bi weekly. And these folks don't have the support that they need in order to even try to be successful. And so they just keep setting up their tents or not even sleeping in a tent sleeping outside somewhere.  I'm not saying that this tiny home village or intentional encampment is going to provide the structure that all of those most vulnerable people need. But it's a huge start that is been well received in over 20 to 30 cities in the United States over the past handful of years. And so I think it's a real missed opportunity for us to not use this funding, especially since we know the huge increase of on house folks due to the pandemic that are not being served well by traditional funding or mechanisms to get folks into housing. It was already in well before the pandemic. And so in concert with having low barrier and no barrier shelters in concert with having permanent supportive housing where we know these folks can move in and be successful. This is a great first step. And again, I will say I'm not asking anyone who's opted out for their awards, even though I don't like it and I don't think it's constitutional. I'm not asking Listen, the amendment for for those wards to be participatory. I'm asking for the wards that are left who have who want to deal with this. To follow me along and follow along best practices and research and fall on the city's continuum of care to do the best we can for our unhoused neighbors.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  05:33
Thank you. All the men from the fifth? Do you have anything further?

James Page, 5th ward Alderman  05:41
Just a closing comment. That is very, very difficult for me to support this amendment speak on a wraparound services, I'd like to see some wraparound planning. I'd like to see some wraparound ownership of this issue by the city at large and the region at large. I would like to not help these facilities concentrated for geographical convenience is very difficult for me to support this without some confidence that these facilities will be executed to a very high standard. And only I understand that have been models in other cities. I've not visited any of them. I have to go by the models that are within the city that I know and love and living in. And those have not been pretty. So without building some confidence in my mind that we've got to take this leap from the encampments we have encountered over the years, to this bright shining city on a hill model that I've never seen implemented in this city. I have trouble making that leap. I always keep everything I say and do is the core of it is concerned about our unhoused citizens. But I also am very concerned about our taxpaying citizens who are paying the freight to make this city work, and the safety and quality of life of my constituents in the fifth Ward, and in downtown St. Louis. With that I will close. Thank you for your time, Mr. President.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  07:45
All the one from the fourth.

Dwinderlin Evans, 4th ward Alderwoman  07:49
Thank you, Mr. Chair. We have a alderman from the six yield for questions. All one from the six. We yield a question from all along from the fourth. Absolutely. All on from fourth. Please proceed. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'm alderman from the six. I wanted to know where well, you said tower Grove east. The question was, where are these going to be located? And your answer was? Is that a question to me? Yes.

Christine Ingrassia, 6th ward Alderwoman  08:32
Yes. That's a great question. I've tried to find space in the sixth Ward where it made sense. Again,

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  08:41
online, please make a point of order.

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  08:44
Maybe I missed something. But I don't know if the alarm for six yielded to the alderman from the fourth.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  08:49
No, she did not get all the ones in the fourth. Would you like the other one from the 16 year question? Yes, I would all on the for the sixth year and all along for the fourth.

Christine Ingrassia, 6th ward Alderwoman  09:02
Yes, I will again because I just answered that question and said yes.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  09:08
Please proceed all the way from for.

Dwinderlin Evans, 4th ward Alderwoman  09:12
My question was, where are these being located?

Christine Ingrassia, 6th ward Alderwoman  09:18
Yeah, and that's a great question. Thank you so much for asking it. There are no plans right now for the location of these intentional encampments. I have tried desperately to find space in the sixth Ward because I am a proponent of them. And again, I'm not asking anyone who has opted out under the committee substitute as amended to opt back in. So I'm hoping that anybody who was not interested in having an intentional encampment, or a tiny home village, that's not Tied to just veterans is okay with it since we've had quite a bit of discussion on on on that. And before we were here today.

Dwinderlin Evans, 4th ward Alderwoman  10:14
I just want to make a make a statement. When I heard you mentioned intentional encampments, I cringed a little bit. Because when I think of intentional encampments, I think about the Germans, encampments, or Jews were in prison. Now I know that's, that's, that's just how I feel about the word, intentional encampment. And, and encampment. Now I have a project, as well as alderman Alderman, Todd, and Alderwoman. Davis, we have a project that consists of veterans, tiny home, where it has, as Alderman Boyd had said, it's like a tiny house. It's a house. It's like a tiny house. We call them veterans homes. And it has the facility of everything in a house. bathroom, kitchen, das sleeping quarters all in a tiny house, a tiny home, and there's a sample of it. That's on grand and owl dine. So if you get a chance to drive by you can see a replica of what the tiny Veterans Home is. Now. That's what I thought you were asking funding for other than the tiny homes that now I understand is totally different from the veteran homes project that we have. That's that's going to be presented in the fourth 18th and 19th. War.

Christine Ingrassia, 6th ward Alderwoman  12:27
I don't think that's accurate. I think that you and I are mostly on the same Page in terms of what we're thinking about.

Dwinderlin Evans, 4th ward Alderwoman  12:35
Okay, but you're saying a tiny, tiny house, but is it? Do those homes consist of a total living quarters, kitchen, bedroom, bath, all of that, within that structure?

Christine Ingrassia, 6th ward Alderwoman  12:54
And so that's one of the reasons that we are increasing funding is that the mayor's office was first using I think I'm not, I think they just didn't understand what an intentional encampment was, again, I mentioned before that Denver is the only city that I've ever found in my research over the past couple of years that use actual tents. They were ISIS fishing tents. And so there are a variety of ways in which Tiny Homes work, the tiny home village at Jefferson and MLK that a number of alderman have been supportive of really just have like sleeping structures and the ability to charge your cell phone type of a thing. And everything that I've looked into does everything that that tiny home project does and possibly more in terms of having restroom facilities and a tiny kitchen in that place. But absent the ability for that to be in one enclosure. The the most successful Tiny Home villages have community kitchens, they have restrooms on site, they have showers on site. So those things are addressed. Absolutely. And I appreciate you asking about it.

Dwinderlin Evans, 4th ward Alderwoman  14:22
Okay, well, I would hope that all of that would be embodied within that one structure, which is what the tiny veterans village consists of, therefore, I think it's just a better living inhabitant for, for the people. Yeah, yep. It's,

Christine Ingrassia, 6th ward Alderwoman  14:55
I think it's it's more ideal if you don't visualize this as Something that's transitional. Tiny Home villages are supposed to be transitional until we can get folks into a better situation such as permanent supportive housing, which we do have allocation of funding for under the cares Act, which we already pass at the board and through this allocation of funding as well.

Dwinderlin Evans, 4th ward Alderwoman  15:25
Okay, I just wish that there was another heading that you could use instead of intentional encampments. Because that just seems so harsh to me. And I'm, and I'm sorry, I need to change my mindset. But that's just how I feel. Well, I

Christine Ingrassia, 6th ward Alderwoman  15:44
get it. And that's why I in the amendment, you'll see that I changed intentional encampments to Tiny Homes, Tiny Home villages.

Dwinderlin Evans, 4th ward Alderwoman  15:53
Okay. At this time, I will yield. My time. I'll yield to the floor.

Christine Ingrassia, 6th ward Alderwoman  16:00
Thanks for your questions. alderman.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  16:03
alderman from the 23rd.

Joe Vaccaro, 23rd ward Alderman  16:06
So these will the Alderwoman, six word.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  16:17
Question into alderman from the 23rd. Nothing would make me happier.

Joe Vaccaro, 23rd ward Alderman  16:23
Oh, that's on the 23rd. Please. So does this eliminate any tense? Yes, it does. And I would like to a list of all the wards that these will not be going. Can you provide me with the list of all the ones that have opted out?

Christine Ingrassia, 6th ward Alderwoman  16:42
You can find that underneath the drive under board built to committee substitute as amended. If you want me to find it for you and read it to you like a bedtime story. I

Joe Vaccaro, 23rd ward Alderman  16:52
can I love bedtime stories. 

Christine Ingrassia, 6th ward Alderwoman  16:54
Okay, do you want me to sing it to you? Or just 

Joe Vaccaro, 23rd ward Alderman  16:57
you know what? I'm First off, you're being very rude, which is normal. So since you can't answer that question, I would like to make a motion that the 23rd Ward is opted out then. You know, I can't support something that the sponsor can't speak to. So I would like to make a motion that the 23rd board is opted out of this. It's been moved by from 23rd that the 23rd Ward is opted out.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  17:34
Second. Seconded by all the ones from six. A further discussion. All in favor signify by saying aye. VOTE BEING TAKEN (unanimous besides 25) Aye. Aye. I oppose Oh, motion carries. 

Joe Vaccaro, 23rd ward Alderman  17:48
Okay, now. Please make note of that off the 23rd Ward should be an exempt for Oh, no. But I just wanted to be clear. As I'm voting on this, that won't happen. We set the tents up for people are going to just be living like tent villages. These are going to be tiny homes that have would have bathrooms and you know that they're not TENTS.

Christine Ingrassia, 6th ward Alderwoman  18:25
Yes, they're not tents, as I indicated just a couple minutes ago when you asked.

Joe Vaccaro, 23rd ward Alderman  18:32
Okay, well, that's really all my questions. I'm no, I am sorry that you were so rude as to say, gee, you want me to sing it to you. You want me to tell you a bedtime story? Obviously, you have personal issues. And you know, when you treat people rude. That's unacceptable. But for you, I'll put you in my prayers. You got a lot of issues.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  19:01
of order from the 11th alderman from the 11th all the ones from the 11th personal attack after another breaking up Alderwoman

Sarah Wood Martin, 11th ward Alderwoman  19:19
is one personal attack after another. If someone feels wrong, they don't have to keep it going.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  19:28
I I agree. All their alderman from the Knights saw the one from the 11th video one Alderwoman from the ninth. It's been a long day but we're getting there. alderman from the night.

Dan Guenther, Alderman ward 9  19:49
Thank you, Mr. President. I appreciate you calling on me. However I've been watching the hands and the Alderwoman from the 15th the Alderwoman from the 19th in your room, from the The 11th or up before I will, so I will yield. Thank you.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  20:04
Good person. Thank you. All the woman's 15.

Dr. Megan Green, 15th ward Alderwoman  20:12
Thank you, Mr. President, members of the board, I also wanted to thank the Alderwoman from the six for bringing this forward. And just make it clear. You know, since the 15th word has been mentioned several times today, as has has tower Grove that, you know, I have no intention of opting the 15th Ward, or tower Grove out of this, I do think that, historically, a lot of wrongs have been committed in our city by concentrating our unhoused population in certain areas of the city. And I do think that that is very unfair. You know, I, about 15 years ago, I used to work at an organization called shalom house, that shelter has since closed, but we handled some of the most difficult cases in St. Louis have chronic homeless women who were had dual diagnosis. You know, this is an issue that is near and dear to my heart. And I think a lot of residents in the 15th Ward are well are willing to open our arms to figuring out how we as a community can work to, to have our fair share, of working to address this issue. And, and I am committed to working on that I'm committed to, you know, figuring out how we bring in more services and can carry our fair share in the 15th. Ward and, and not OPT us out, I think it's very important that Southside wards, wards that do have that are gentrifying, that do have increasing housing values are carrying our fair share of this of affordable housing, a permanent supportive housing of homeless shelters of Assisi houses, which is something that the Alderwoman of the eighth and I did work together to bring into the 15th Ward and open up and there, there was some, you know, initial resident hesitancy around it. But we brought together that community and we we, you know, addressed those concerns and got folks to recognize that we really do have a responsibility to each other. And so I'm, you know, I'm just thankful for the Alderwoman from the six for her leadership on this. And I do intend to do my part as a sell side representative and an area that has not historically carried our fair share of the burden in addressing city wide issues and addressing regional issues in in figuring out how we address this going forward. And, and one last thing I will say we do have an unintentional encampment in the 15th Ward, I have struggled with it for six years, we have during that time been able to get the folks in this camp meant to be housed for all of two days. And it is it is difficult. And sometimes we have to be able to provide a diversity of options to meet people where they are, when they are not ready for housing or not ready for the support systems that we are, you know, wanting them to, to be ready for. And that's sometimes really difficult, sometimes means very challenging conversations with our own residents who maybe don't understand why why folks are living the way that they are. And, and I take my you know, role as an elected official, as needing to do some of that education. So that we can actually get folks the services that they need, meet them where they are, provide the diversity of options. And the final thing that I will say is the entirety of this stimulus bill provides a transformative level of funds into homeless into addressing homeless services for the entire continuum of care, to provide a variety of housing options for folks that, you know, that tiny house or pallet shelter, you know, path is is where they're ready is is the place that they are right now. And that's the services that they that they need today, all the way up to permanent supportive housing and in those wraparound services that we've all talked about, and it's a safe haven and an emergency shelter. And so we are providing a tremendous amount of resources to build out and support our unhoused community in a way We have not been doing in this city. And and so I think we have a tremendous opportunity here. And I just want to be clear that, that I think that those of us on the sell side have not carried our fair share of this. And we do need to engage as active partners, all of us and bringing, you know, resources into our communities, and making sure that that we are also working to locate sites working to find places so that this is so that our unhoused neighbors are not concentrated just in one area, or another of the city, that we really are working in partnership. Because folks who are unhoused really do exist all across our city. They do you know, where there's a business district where there are houses, there are people who are unhoused, too. And so we, you know, we really need to work together to make sure that we're all doing our part.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  25:57
All right, thanks. All the 101 from 19.

Marlene Davis, Alderwoman ward 19  26:04
Thank you, Mr. President, members of board, I'll be brief. It is so unfortunate that we we continue to try to move forward without having conversations with those with experience. I don't think that currently, those who have all this passion, even know 50% of what is currently available, it can't be expanded upon. You walk past drive past places that you don't realize mentally challenged people live there. They're taught to be there in those apartments with care given to them. They have jobs that they're capable of doing. You don't talk to organizations like challenge unlimited challenges, unlimited, who has a special way of dealing with a lot of the people that we need to care for. We also don't even know about the homes that have been donated, renovated, the has transitional housing for homeless who come and live there. And they can live there for as long as two and a half years to be stabilized. You don't even know that that exist. You don't know that I'm purging between union and devolver. And those big matches that there are mental health homes there. One lady retired nurse, she was in a big home on one side street, one other she has four to six clients and each one, they're well taken care of. We are many options that can be used, but nobody talks to you. So you can't help them. It's a veteran's home here in this ward. Most people don't even know they're there. Because it's managed so well. And many of those guys have. And women have a lot of challenges, whether it's physical or mental. But again, you're trying to, to move in a direction without the appropriate understanding, or knowledge and expertise that is required. You can't continue to walk away from the experience that is out here. Salvation Army is one of the oldest organizations in providing these services. They should be at the table, and many others that have been doing this work for 5060 years. So I opted out because I probably have one or two of everything, including drug treatment centers and everything else. So I just I don't know what else to say. We heard it on the news, saying they want to sleep are sad. Nobody wants to sleep outside. That is absolutely not true. You have to help people come to a better place. And what I saw Saturday when I went downtown, it was just so sad. It was so sad to see those people's clothes blown and other personal items all over everywhere. They were dressed and they will huddle and a little income wherever they could try to get out of the element. Ted's collapsed and blown away in it. Why why why? I have just had it. I have had it. I have tried to reach out and help. But you know what? Keep on bumping your head. Thank you very much.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  29:52
All right. All the men from the 18th

Jesse Todd, 18th ward Alderman  29:59
Thank you Mr. President, thank you, but about a people as a previous unhappy person, oh, cause I support housing for everybody. In fact, I think housing is a human right. However, at this time, I have to opt out until I discussed this with my constituents. And the reason is because of the platform, I gave my constituents my word, and I keep my word in bad. Ad told them, as I've said, since at before I was old enough to vote, when I was honored to be had in a public program many years ago, that I believed then and I believe in now maximum feasible, citizens participation. What does that mean? That means, in the 18th, Ward, I ran on the platform, that it would be citizens driven, meaning we have six, five or six organizations that make decisions about what come into that area, I promise them that. That's the promise, a promise made will be a promise kept by me. And so I will have to discuss this week, my constituents, I will give them all the information I can give them. As certainly, at the same time, we cannot forget that. I don't want to set up any program that instead of the fail, we must have this is temporary. And we must, as I said, I worked in the poverty program, we must declare war on poverty. And as I said earlier today, we must also do like Dr. Kane was getting ready to do which is having poor people's campaign. Certainly we do have jobs following the guaranteed annual income and drug treatment. And these camps at the present time had to have proper supervision. I'm not talking about holy sin, necessarily, but I'm talking about proper supervision from professional and from professional people, we had professional jobs. These are the cabin job that we need to be thinking about creating in the first place not not the type of job to be quiet people's to carry guns that don't and lock people up. I don't care whether the state, local, state or federal level unless they present a danger to other people. Of course, they have to be locked up. You can't have people there and other people, I even taken other people thing, but they will continue to take other people things until poverty is eliminated. That's a different topic. I have I didn't have the most, we cannot have a temporary we need temporary housing, but it cannot become a way of life. We must look for permanent housing tests. We get tests. I'm glad we said 10 a house because this is a step in the right direction. Anyone need to place a lady here and believe me at been homeless as a teenager. I know how it is when you don't have no place to lay your head. And when it's one or two o'clock in the morning, you out in the street by yourself. As a young person, that's not a good feeling. And it would not. And some of these? Well, it's not I'm not gonna say Tesco we've gotten away from it. It must be way of playing. Because we don't plan it. Well, what will happen is it will be they will we don't want it to be set up to fail because of it fail, then the people can point the thing is they see I told you they were we tried that and it failed. It must be right. It must be center, right? It must be a demand, it must be a movement. That's how we got and we must have a movement. And we must have a mental health wrap around the drugs it It must be it and also it must be said to finish up. We must declare war on poverty. It must be convenient for the neighborhood. I have to continue to educate the neighborhood, it must provide In summary, again to permanent homes, a guaranteed annual income drug treatment. And it must blend them with the community. And we do if we can put a personal on the moon if we can try to go to Mars, we can put permanent houses and stop tearing down these houses on lots. And we pay $15 million a year to cut lots. We could put houses on lots and we could build permanent houses. So the program needs to need to say this is temporary. We're going to be a permanent house. And I believe in compromising but that cannot be compromised and when people When we can build war when we have enough, probably 1000 times, enough bombs and planes and stuff to destroy the world. And we can use those monies, to build houses and create jobs and get rid of that old vacant lot. And we can raise the taxes, sometimes that will raise taxes, we will be safer, we will have money, when we have a guaranteed annual income. Some people even talk about what we do that we won't even have the conversation about the funding the police cars, we added the taxes will be generated to pay the police, we whatever we need, parks, forestry, drug treatment job. So the point is less Do I have to opt out temporary, temporarily until I talk with my constituents based on the fact that at promised I would get with them and get their opinion. And if I can get anyone else to volunteer and come talk with them, I'm asking you, and whatever, if they say do it at dude, if the organization that promised to have a lead, make the final decision when this possible, but until I talk with them, and until they say so I have to temporarily, I cannot support anything without consulting the organizations that already have planes in each area. And we don't have very much land left in our world. So therefore, but I do have to talk with them. And if they say yes, of course, I'm gonna do it. But right now, I temporarily has have to opt out not only on this, but on anything I opt out on until I talk with the Mac and the organization's in my word, because they make the final decision about anything, anytime is possible. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you both of our people.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  36:57
Alright, thank you, alderman Alderwoman, from the lemat.

Sarah Wood Martin, 11th ward Alderwoman  37:02
Thank you, Mr. President. I'd like to

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  37:07
please proceed. Alderwoman.

Sarah Wood Martin, 11th ward Alderwoman  37:09
Thank you, I very much appreciate it with alderman said. But I also really appreciate the fifth and the 22nd. I understand where they're coming from. I know that the downtown wards are very stressed with encampment. And I know that I have a few in my ward, but they're all come and go. I talked about this in the HUD meeting is very difficult, because at the end of the day, whether we construct these tiny homes or temporary, whatever you want to call them temporary shelters, we're going to have an unknown population, this city with folks at the state level talk about, you know, schools and student populations. One major challenge in our city is that we have an enormous amount of on how children, these are children that don't have a regular home. We have folks who want to go into some of the housing, discuss by some of the organizations that offer it. I know I have a lot of transitional housing in my ward, not one type of housing option. For those transitioning out of the justice system. There are all types of unhealed folks that are all type people who cannot. That includes those who just like Alderwoman, six, that those interesting people who are not ready for permanent housing, and the people who run these programs have come to the table. And this is one of their suggestions. So this is not just out of the blue. This is something that the experts and those who have been working for years, with unhoused populations and mental health experts have brought to the table. That said, I also feel what the alderman services and the alderman from the teams are saying to AI based that on the reality is I don't know how my constituents would really feel about this. I tend to think it probably would not necessarily be that popular. But I also know that I have experienced that are not densely residential and to be open to it. So I don't know if this is something that we should table and discuss later. I also know that we are facing a potential eviction crisis. So I'm not being overly decisive here. But I just I do want to make sure that we are operating in reality, and that whether or not we go through with this amendment, we will still have unhoused people in this city and it is a burden or this is an issue To that all major cities face, you're not unique. I think what's changing is that a cities are getting funds to attempt to help the unhoused. And also, this is just becoming a more popular topic that, you know, we have a major dividing class in this country. And I know that my family members who live in wealthy city or wealthy areas or major cities in the code, they have a problem there. So I just want to speak to this and make sure that we are dealing with the fact so thank you very much.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  40:39
Okay, all the way from the knife.

Dan Guenther, Alderman ward 9  40:50
Thank you, Mr. President. Can you hear me? Am I alive?

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  40:53
Yes, you're live all the way live. I'm live. All right.

Dan Guenther, Alderman ward 9  40:59
As we're approaching APM, 10 hours for us. I'm gonna try to keep it short, but you know, I won't. So this is one of the one of the amendments that I have been passionate about, as well as the direct cash assistance. I'm, the reason I'm passionate about this is because I like a lot of my south side. cohorts do have a severe issue here. And I agree with what the Alderwoman from the SEC said early, early, early on, about maybe calling it intentional encampments got people in the wrong mindset. So because of that, she has changed it to being let's focus on the pallet houses, tiny houses, with the idea that a communal approach to the unhoused is better than the approach we have now. And I will say that I, I truly appreciate the Alderwoman from the six, having worn this issue on her shoulder emotionally, more than most of us, and I am with her on this. And when I speak to our unhoused population, and they and I asked them what they want, they want fresh running water. As the alderman from the 22nd brought up about the three S's. They want to have a place to shower, they want to have a place to use the restroom. And they want to have a place to shave. And they also want laundry service. And they also want to be connected to all these other programs that we're setting them up with right now, whether it be vaccinations, or whether it be free bus passes. They want these services in one location. And so the idea of intentional communities was having a location where people were able to feel comfortable and secure and respected. And so I fully support this amendment. I would hope that any of our other people that have any questions about this will fully support it. Besides bringing up the alderman from the 22nd, the alderman from the fifth brought up the problem he has and I understand I'm downtown a lot. I would implore every one of the 29 of us to look at the map of the wards and see that the second Ward Alderwoman Middlebrook has a huge issue with Riverfront property. And then we go to a small slice of the fifth. But we all know that the Alderman Page that Alderman Page has a majority of these issues, and we want to support them. You then go the old man from the seventh, who has downtown all the way to city street. And you will notice that the Alderwoman from the second alderman from the fifth alderman from the seventh all opted out of intentional commitments. Before we were able to clarify what we really are looking for here, which is creating a community where people can receive services they need. You go south a city street and it's the Ninth Ward and the 11th ward. So for myself, and the older month of the 11th to not be able to speak on this issue and not be able to say I have a major problem. And I want to make this as safe and comfortable. And the best way to get people that put a tent up every night in a different location because police run them out of parks as A guy that loves sleeping in tents, I will say maybe that's not a problem. But I will take a step up and say put them in a tiny home, put them in a tiny home in a community. And what we're doing here is we're allowing people to say I have an address to be able to get my services. I have a location that places for people that are now in the ninth ward can find them, which is our mental health provider for the city. I have a St. Peter and Paul, I have the sales community Corporation. I have a Who else do I have? I have a guardian angel settlement Association. I have service providers in the ninth ward. And from Sydney, Sri south, myself in the 11th. Ward share all of the riverfront, and we have land to be able to provide places. So for all the all the people that have decided to opt out, there were 12 of them in the last one because they thought intentional encampments was a bad thing. For all the people that have opt out. I would say, if I wasn't worried about us being here, 12 hours, I wouldn't make a friendly amendment to have an opt in. And I will say the ninth war will opt in to taking on this issue in the city. And I would hope that would help alleviate some worries from other Northside alderman. And so that's all I have to say, Mr. President, and I always encourage you to vote to support our most vulnerable communities. Thank you. All right. Thank

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  46:38
you, alderman from the 22nd.

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  46:44
Oh, we Okay. Thank you, Mr. President, members of the board. So let me talk a little bit about history. I've been on my 18 years. And when I became alderman 2003, downtown was like a ghost town. Downtown was filled with we call them homeless then but we now they're unhappy population. And they defecated on the streets and did their business. But Reverend Rice did the best he could to house them. He didn't have a facility that really was up the coal, but he did the best he could, in order to keep them off the street. And then you had john step one, pyramid construction, and he came in and he started buying warehouses downtown. He started, you know, creating residential opportunities for people downtown and downtown became a booming place. So over 20 years, we actually have an incredible downtown, compared to what it was two decades ago, anybody that don't really don't know how far we've come. the last administration decided that Reverend Rice, you know, what he was providing for the homeless was not suitable and needed to deal with the problem, because the downtown residents was like, we can't take it anymore, because we're paying all this money for our condos, and our quality of life has been impacted, but really, they encroached upon the unhoused, because they was there before they got there. Okay. And so you had this paradigm shift from going to a downtown where nobody cared about, like North St. Louis, to a place where they started building and started booming and, and so people wanted a better quality and they deserve a better client. They're paying a lot of money, you know, to live downtown. And so they were able to get, you know, revenue rise facility shut down, and to the credit of my colleague from the 23rd, what he fought that he fought against that and he you think it was fair, and he was one of the champions from Redmond Rice with the unhoused population, but it fail. Um, I have two churches in my ward. That took on house population. And it was unsightly. Because they dedicated around the church because they don't want to get in at certain times of the day. The church wanted to be partners among the church, the church, we talked about the church. They wanted to be partners, but they can only let them in during certain times of the day in between time. There were no outside facilities for him to go to so they did their business around the church to the point where the church had to say, time out, can't do this anymore. People my neighbor was screaming and hollering, they were up in arms and they couldn't take it any more. Because it wasn't conducive for a residential area. I've heard somebody talk about the um house for children, family. I mean, I,  But then I'm glad that I've never seen on house family living on the street. I'm fortunate that I have a hope house in my neighborhood, which is a transitional home for mothers with children. And they do a phenomenal job with wraparound services with daycare and everything they can to support those families. So that certainly should be a priority. And I know that has been a priority. You know, women with children, making sure we get them off the street. Because I just when I see, you know, the unhoused on the street, I don't see families, I see individuals. I just want to ask my colleagues, and I don't want to put anybody on the spot, but I want to do a roll call. I want you to raise your hand and shout out your ward. No. alderman Gunther from the Ninth Ward already did he say Hey, bring them to the Ninth Ward. I want to bring them in, put them right in the middle of Sioux Lord, wherever you got to put them. I'm 100%. Forward. But I want to hear from other people. Anybody else? Shout out your ward number. This is a roll call. Shout it out. Eighth ward. You won't be

Joe Vaccaro, 23rd ward Alderman  51:17
on the

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  51:19
order. point of order. alderman from the 22nd.

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  51:25
Okay, you're right. You're right. I apologize. Mr. President, I'm out of order. I accept it because I can always do a roll call by asking them, every alderman would just yield. Yes. And I don't want to take all that time up to do that. But I'm sure I'm not going to get a lot

James Page, 5th ward Alderman  51:41
of hands. Right.

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  51:43
At the end of the day, okay. So I just I mean, I don't get it with their $750,000. that's currently in the board bill. For the unhoused population. There's no real data to support expanding it. I mean, generally, I mean, I just wouldn't have a problem. I don't want them in my I don't want to deal with it. Right now. I'm not saying I don't want to necessarily Mo. I don't want to deal with it right now. Because I have too many critical issues to deal with, then to deal with that.  But there's already $750,000. And I think if the spouse of this amendment wants it in her award that she should have that and how what but it should be defined. The other problem is I heard it come up because there's this confusion. But what is the tiny home a veteran home I can't met, but it's not defined anywhere. So I'm okay with the administration determine what what it's what it looks like. But $750 is a good start. And we could come back and September and make a $20 million. That's fine with me if a whole lot. alderman says bringing in my word bringing on okay. But I'm going to ask the alderman from the fifth Ward if he will yield for a question.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  53:05
All the men from the fifth will yield to question until all the men from the 22nd

James Page, 5th ward Alderman  53:14
gladly, I'll be happy to. 

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  53:16
Okay. Autumn I know, you know, gave some testimony as to you know, how you felt about the amendment and what's wrong with more, but  I remember your predecessor when they wanted to do Biddle house. She was damn metrically opposed. vemehently, opposed and all of my colleagues that are here right now that was serving with former Alderwoman tomikka hubbard knows, she fought tooth and nail. Let me ask you, alderman, how was the middle house working out in your neighborhood?

James Page, 5th ward Alderman  53:55
It it is working out in general. Well, and for a number of reasons. 

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  54:02
Okay. 

James Page, 5th ward Alderman  54:03
It is not it's in an industrial area. The closest heavily populated area to it is the McDonald's drive thru. So it is it. I have very few complaints. I've not received any complaints about it from my constituents, but I have to put a but in there. But Biddle houses limited to 120 people 120 beds nightly. Yeah, what is happening recently is that there's a spillover. They have more demands than they have beds. And I've gotten information from constituents that call me some late at night. concerned that people are doing a pop up or unintentional encampment in a city owned or MSD own rain garden area adjacent to one of my gated townhouse communities. So Biddle house itself i have i've never received any issues.  Okay, I have actually donated, prepared foods there for the residents to consume. But the issue is the spillover. Right? I'll leave it there. I hope that question.

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  55:35
And I'm glad to hear that. Because I know personally, that it was problematic early on to the point where the city was changed the contractors and it was hard to find another, you know, provider to take over those services. So I'm glad they cleaned it up. But what's kind of interesting about that is what you said is pretty much kind of like an industrial area. Although I do hear from time to time that the McDonald's is probably not happy with it, you know, because I've visited that McDonald's before, and I see them out begging people, you know, on the McDonald's parking lot, so I don't think the McDonald's is pretty happy with it. And and I, and I've heard also, and maybe you haven't heard this that, you know, drug dealers prey on people down there. And so that's not helpful. So that is, uh huh. That is a fact that they do. Okay. Okay. So, you know, location, location and location is important. And we have to really think about our location as we look at supporting on house in the best way possible. Mr. President, we've been at this for quite some time. We're past 10 hours. And I like to call for the previous question.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  56:57

Tom Oldenburg, Alderman ward 16  1:19:24
Thank you Mr. President. I moved introduced the floor substitute please.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:19:30
Is it everybody's drive obviously moved but alderman from the 16th floor substitute. Second second. Seconded by alder from the seventh and on from the third. You got you guys that alderman from the 16th Please proceed what you want me to do you want to talk about the floor substitute or you want to?

Tom Oldenburg, Alderman ward 16  1:19:54
Certainly I will mention the floor substitute quickly. This was in consultation with With two members, the Alderwoman from the 26th, as well as the alderman from the third. From the Public Safety Committee when this was heard, I had had a few tweaks they wanted to make around the language. As you'll see, this is a pretty direct and short board bill, the changes that wanted to be made where the let's define for the purposes of this ordinance successive, as well as limiting what would be, you know, the jail time from 90 to 30 days. Again, overall, those were changes that seemed fine. To me. Again, this this this ordinance, this board bill is certainly covered by state law, under attempt attempted larceny, but no municipality in the country that I could find, expressly, or specifically touches on the attempted burglary around the door flip behandeling. We know we have crews that run through all of our neighborhoods at night constantly and successfully flipping door handles the point of this legislation really is to memorialize it because the police department is not taking reports on it. Spend a handful of instances where cameras have caught individuals flipping successive door handles, report was made to the police and response back to the from the police department was lock your doors and this isn't a crime flipping door handles. So there's two things wrong with that. The answer or response back to just lock your doors is is not something that's well received by residents, you should be able to have the liberty and freedom to live absent minded in a city and forgetting to lock your doors and not have your personal belongings and and personal effects refers to and or stolen. The other part is that why aren't we collecting data on this? Is that why can't we have a protective proactive excuse me crime strategy around the attempted larceny, because if if the handle is in the car is open, you have larceny, so that this really is to hyper localize it so that the police department will work with us and begin to hopefully formulate a strategy around what I believe and I think a lot of resonance is a very scary and serious crime. So the floor substitute I got a little off there. Mr. presidents are the floor substitute specifically addresses what successive show mean, right. And it's pretty clear the lifting of door handles or otherwise trying locks and vehicles one after another. I think reasonable people be able to find out what success it means. And then limiting the jail time that that was changed that the alderman from the Alderwoman from the 26th thought was appropriate and I certainly agreed with her. Nothing further. All right,

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:23:06
thank you all the men, all the men from the 24th alderman from the 24th grade it looks like the screen is locked up August 24. alderman from a team

Jesse Todd, 18th ward Alderman  1:23:24
Thank you Mr. President and thank you both all the people my concern I have two concerns about this bill let me be crystal clear. Number one, we should be trying to prevent crime. This bill takes up a lot of police time here we are paying police if we take up all the police this time about sematic just mess with my door handle and we take up some time and then this just add an extra burden and then a person should be innocent until proven guilty. I remember one time I got confused and this costume oh but I got confused when I went to the wrong car look just like my car actually almost got in the car. But I was innocent. I wasn't trying to steal it today, Mr. President. But suppose somebody walked out and say look, he's messing with my axon, which is true. He was I was messing with the dough hammer in fact out and getting almost getting the content or recognizing when my car saw some things in there. But the point I'm making is if I go to the wrong if someone else goes to the wrong car. I don't the end and people are hostile and nervous and and and the person may not look may not look the same as look. Some people may look suspicious and what some people may invest Especially they may be dressed in may be based on race. And maybe most, most time when you talk about crime, let me be perfectly frank, you're talking about black people. And we have enough people in jail for wasting our tax dollar with the police who we pay about 2030. But more than $35 an hour, Paul and somebody infamous with a door latch, we need to be talking about making sure that a guaranteed annual income so people don't have to steal this the answer to the problem, and it costs us $30,000 a year to keep a person in jail. That's what we need to take the same money and keep them out of jail. People don't go around breaking in code and stealing anything or robbing with guns, bats, hand grenades, knives, or whatever, to get money, they robbed to get money. So to run to not deal with the true root cause of the problem is only going to cost us the taxpayers more money in the long run, and we will not be any safer. If that person is locked up, they got a police record for suspected of stealing, then that person got another problem. And that problem would be passed right on to us as taxpayers in a society where all that printing go do is get isolated and become go to the workhouse at first, which is like going to elementary school, then you go to junior high school, you go to one of the lower class president and then you get to University of greed back on prison, the person I'm concerned about number one is the taxpayer. I'm a steward of the taxpayers money. And I just don't believe that these Teddy's the crown that can be prevented, I think we should do everything in our power as a society to prevent every crime. We don't know if the person who's locked up data, but we know one person who the person who is the victim is number one is the person that happened to number two is the taxpayers because the criminal justice system, and all his support staff, as a group, and these are nice people, most of them, but the system itself has proven to be totally any effective. And it only what it does, is very popular call we what we are doing now. This is a book that I have right here. Now, the fund fear, which we need to stop scamming people and tell them we're gonna make them safe by locking up people, all we're doing is making them more unsafe, this has proven, we had data to prove that locking up a bunch of people from peda craft, where we could have a guarantee that your income is totally ineffective. So I oppose this bill on this. And plus, it can again, lead to point now people and you, again poor black people, and arrestment a lot of the things that we will be able to do a better job. And we will be safer and more effective than we could if we would just stick with what we know works. And here's the book called The font is called defund fear, safety without policing prisons and punishment. I'm recommending that this book be read by everybody. Because we need to prevent crime. And most people not all, most people with the proper resources would be just fine. So again, it's not the number of police. It's not the number of administration of justice, people. But it's that are the same as communities. It is the communities that have the most resources and this and it was her constantly telling us who live outside our community is about all of these other things. They had resources. That's why they don't have to kill him. That's why they don't have the stealing. That's why they don't have high crime rate. And I oppose this bill on the on the ground. They could relate to also profiling, profiling poor black and poor white people. Thank you, Mr. President.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:29:27
I was muted alderman from the 24th.

Bret Narayan, 24th Ward Alderman  1:29:31
Thank you, Mr. President, members of the board. I know when the alderman from the 16th and I spoke about this in committee. I was supportive of this. It's it's a big problem in my ward. I know. It's a big problem throughout the rest of the city as well. There were some concerns raised in the committee hearing and I know that in that hearing, we got it out of the committee with a do pass recommendation on the ID That, that the alderman from the 16th. So it's going to work with the public safety director on on a floor substitute. I'm just curious if if this is that floor substitute if you had that chance to meet, I know this meeting came up.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:30:15
Would you want to inquire about moving to six? Yeah, I would like to inquire from the alderman from the 16th. All the way from the 16th. Question to alderman from the 24th. Well, yes. The 24th. Please proceed.

Bret Narayan, 24th Ward Alderman  1:30:28
Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, alderman from the 16th. As I'm sure you recall, and the public safety committee, we kind of went back and forth and seemingly kind of reluctantly got it out. On on kind of a fast pace based on the idea that you were going to be bringing a floor substitute after talking to the Director of Public Safety is is this that floor substitute?

Tom Oldenburg, Alderman ward 16  1:30:56
So I don't know it passed unanimously out of committee. I don't know if that reluctantly. But I will say you're correct in me saying that I was meeting with the public safety director, after a month of inquiring of both he and the Chief, to have feedback on this. During that committee, I finally got. As the committee as I was presenting the bill, I received a text from the public safety directors aide or our employee that to meet on this. So I mentioned that that was going to take place that was supposed to take place today at noon. Obviously, I've been in this Zoom Room with you all. You know, and quite frankly, I did take the time later that over the weekend to meet with two members of the committee that also raised some concerns, I don't think that this is going to be detrimental to the public safety director or his police department, quite frankly, they aren't enforcing this anyway, I hope and aim that they will capture as a result of being a local ordinance. Because it's already illegal to attempt a vehicle. So not having had the chance to meet with them. They can perhaps implement something to policy if they have great concerns. But I'd like to move forward and perfect today.

Bret Narayan, 24th Ward Alderman  1:32:27
Understood so. So nothing I say is going to gonna convince you to wait and get get that feedback for what I would say.

Tom Oldenburg, Alderman ward 16  1:32:36
I took feedback from committee members that had some that had some concerns. And that's the thrust behind this for substitute. You know, I guess I'm, I'm not trying to be petty here. But I mean, you you have something for a month and you get you get ghosted? You know, if it's one thing I've learned, it's, you know, policymakers don't like to be ignored when, you know, constantly, you know, when when I was looking at surveillance legislation, it was you're not, you don't have enough feedback, you don't have enough feedback for buy in from the public safety directors and the Chief, I made a point here in a public safety bill to get just that feedback. And for Redford to just rest in silence for four weeks, and then during the committee presentation, say, Oh, we might want to talk about this. And I tried to set the meeting I did. But you know, I think in terms of prioritizing here, alderman, I put I decided to put the the ARPA funds in a debate around that, and the amendments around that as a priority.

Bret Narayan, 24th Ward Alderman  1:33:41
totally understood, and I guess just without that feedback, I have some hesitancy here. So I'm not going to oppose it. I'm not going to, you know, try and get in your way. Because that, like I said, this is a big issue throughout the city. But I'm gonna be present today. If for whatever reason, you're not successful today. I'm certainly happy to to work with you moving forward and try and try and get that feedback. I just have some concerns about what the statistics may do to the way that the police patrol the city as a whole. And like I said, I'm certainly not trying to get in your way with it. I just want to make sure I have all my bases covered. So thank you very much. And with that, I'll

Tom Oldenburg, Alderman ward 16  1:34:24
yield. Thank you, alderman.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:34:28
All the men from the 25th

Shane Cohn, 25th ward Alderman  1:34:36
Thank you, Mr. President. You know, I it's been a long, long meeting. I actually I just tweeted a probably about an hour ago. It's officially the longest meeting I've had in my 12 plus years of service down here at the Board of Aldermen. So congratulations to all the folks that are lesson seniority from me for making it through this very arduous meeting. Today you know, I, I'm listening to the discussion about this particular board bill. And there's a number of things that come to mind. One, the alderman from the 18th Ward reminded me of a very funny story of Aye time when I was actually in, I think it was a target shopping, parking lot and got into the wrong car. And in fact, actually confused it so much with my own car that I tried starting it with the key to my car, and it wouldn't start and I was completely perplexed as to why this car would not start. And then I took me a minute to realize that I was in the complete wrong car and was very embarrassed by that. Obviously, that was an accident. And I wouldn't want an accident to become criminalized. So that being said, on on the lighter side of things, this does happen everywhere across the city, happens in my neighborhood on my blog, I've had my car rummaged through probably three times this year, already, I lost a really nice pair of sunglasses probably about three months ago, that I probably couldn't afford to replace any longer. I was hoping to keep them the rest of my life. But that that unfortunately happens. And, you know, I know many, if not most of my neighbors can share similar stories. And I really have a challenge, though, with this particular board bill, because I struggle with getting police responses on auto accidents or, you know, other, you know, more heinous issues. And it really, I think, to, you know, my colleague from the 18th Ward's point, you know, criminalizing more activity isn't going to make the police more present, it isn't going to solve any issues from that perspective, and it only makes life worse for some other people. And so I just, I am, I guess, if the alderman from the 16th would yield,

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:37:16
alderman from the 16th. To the alderman from the 25th. Well, yes. On the 25th. Please see.

Shane Cohn, 25th ward Alderman  1:37:24
Thank you, alderman. I'll, I'll do my best to keep this brief. But I'm just curious, have you had conversations with the police about responsiveness? I mean, because that is a concern of mine. You know, it is very difficult, I get complaints from people who have had their cars broken into that aren't able to file police reports, they're just told to do it. You know, via phone, you know, there's never a police officer that comes out. I've had, you know, friends and family from the county that have been in town for, you know, baseball games or, you know, other events and the city and haven't had the police respond to them for various issues. You know, similarly, as I mentioned, I've had neighbors that have had issues. And, you know, I mean, I had my window blown out by a bullet, I think it was earlier this year, or it took an hour and a half, and I actually had to escalate it, to get police attention to respond to it. So I guess, have you had those conversations with the police about if they have the capacity to do it? You know, what they think they need in terms of resources, and if they're actually going to be able to do anything about it.

Tom Oldenburg, Alderman ward 16  1:38:36
You know, alderman first, you know, the, you know, we certainly understand mistakes get made, I think that's why successive And clearly, you know, intent and probable cause me to see it. So someone accidentally trying to get into a wrong car, I think that's going to be a very obvious thing to notice. If in the event, it's caught either on camera or by a police officer. So I don't think that this ordinance is over punitive in that regard. In fact, we went to great lengths with a couple members of the committee to talk about what success it means, you know, what this is and what what it is and it's it's pretty clear on the attempt, what I would tell you is that we already trust the police to prioritize, I understand this may not be the highest priority for the police. But Gosh, darn, I mean, when when when my wife and four kids are home alone, and and the ring doorbell camera sees at 1130 or midnight, you know, three or four gentlemen rolling through the street flipping door handles what what if what if, you know, God forbid someone's putting a car seat in the back of a car in fact, we had an incident like that where the This was encountered. I wanted report it and I want the police to take that this serious that that it's a crime and for them to tell residents in any neighborhood, that that's not a crime. We're not going to take a report on it. That's absurd. And I want the data to drive a a real and meaningful crime strategy around this because this is this is a quality of life crime that that is that is actually scary and puts a lot of residents on edge. Particularly if I, you know, look at my ring doorbell, and I am, you know, not at home. And I see, you know, gentlemen cruising down the street, with with my family, you know, 1020 feet away in the house. That's the inspiration for this is that that, of course, we know that I don't know what the police are going to be able to put more manpower on and address it. But I think if we at least start to collect it from a Data View, and the police will agree to that, then we can we can still prioritize crime in this city. But we can maybe put together more proactive strategies around the lower prioritized crime that I know drives our residents crazy, quite frankly.

Shane Cohn, 25th ward Alderman  1:40:56
No, I and I agree with you on that. I haven't noticed I get enough complaints about all sorts of different activity throughout my neighborhood and ward. I guess the the other question I would have for you, alderman and forgive me, I don't have the board bill up in front of me at the moment. But I you know what, I mean, is this just a city offense? So how, what are we kind of labeling this as in terms of the egregious ness of the situation and fines and penalties and things of that nature? You're muted, alderman. Thank you, Alderman.

Tom Oldenburg, Alderman ward 16  1:41:43
Yes, I'm just gonna read the last sentence to you because I think it addresses you any individual found to be in violation of this provision, an ordinance shall be subject to five no more than $500 in a term of imprisonment, if not more than was 90 days now. It's 30 days, or both fine or imprisonment. Okay,

Shane Cohn, 25th ward Alderman  1:42:01
thank you. So I'm gonna just kind of wrap up here myself, you know, we've, I think we all have an email in our inbox from former chief ICM, the current interim public safety director for the city. He indicates that there was some time scheduled for today, and obviously, with the 10 hour long meeting a lot of our calendars that had to be adjusted to accommodate this. But you know, I would like to have the buy in of the Public Safety Office before voting on this. And so you know, what, that I'm gonna just say that, I'll be voting present until those conversations are able to take place. Thank you,

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:42:44
alderman from the Third Ward. Third,

Brandon Bosley, 3rd ward Alderman  1:42:50
thank you, I try to make this quick. I'm definitely in support of the bill, I want to make sure we know that there's a stark difference between someone breaking in your vehicle when attempting to break into a but this border bill does is try to be preventative. So individuals who would eventually get into a vehicle, it doesn't get them put in a position where somebody either themselves has to go out and address them, because these are the problems and issues that we have some times that escalate situations when individuals feel like they can get away with certain things and Dawn laws that give us as residents to be somewhat proactive by saying, Hey, I see something. So I'm going to say something generally, it's too late when you see something somebody is already in your vehicle. And you have to go address it before your vehicles either stolen, or are your precious items or items that you don't want to read this, you know, regardless of whether they're precious to someone else, or neither precious to you, those items are stolen, people get shot, we have plenty of instances where folks just shot over property, especially vehicles. And that's not to say that those things won't continue to happen whether this board bill is here or not. What it what it's saying is generally when you go out and address those people who have broken into your car, that's when the situation escalates either for them. If we catch them on video, because you have to be proven guilty, if we catch them, and they are prosecuted in court, whatever those charges will be, would and should be would and should be much more than it will be for somebody that is attempting to break in the vehicle. So this board bill most certainly doesn't address break ins. What it does do is try to be proactive individuals who are thinking about breaking in and then knowing that hey, I can't not track consecutive door handles, I cannot continue to just walk up and try door handles that's against the law. And now somebody can say something to me about it. Maybe I'll get lucky and I try one and I get in the car. But I can't continually just go and try door handles in any neighborhood within the city. That is of course we all know a big problem and it can be an issue if this is utilized the wrong way by police officers in residence alone but within this Once again, it states what the cause is for an officer to be able to lock you up, which is you have to believe it doesn't say as far as on within the board bill, but just in general, once again, you're innocent until proven guilty. So that resident if you call the police, you'd have to prove that this person was walking from car to car like Alderman Oldenburg said, trying door handles with with no luck, are with look. But either way, this is something that we visibly saw, this is something that we can prove. So in the event that you do have to call 911 and make it report that that person isn't successive, six, he isn't successful, I'm sorry. And breaking in the vehicle, and he just continues to walk down at least you have something to report this outside description of somebody who's going throughout the neighborhood. This is what they look like they weren't able to get into our vehicles. But this is what this person looks like when you see them on the next block. It gives us people who utilize Facebook folks that are next door Twitter, to put out pictures of people who we see doing these particular things. And at least we know, as a neighborhood, if we see them again, we already have evidence it takes to persecute or prosecute those people. So I believe we can look at this as a tool, if anything, as opposed to it being something that is hard on people or puts people in a compromising position, it is prevented, but we start getting people to think a little bit differently about the actions they take before things escalate. Between residents are between police in any criminal situation. So I had completely understand some of the other people's concerns about this can be predatory and the different people that we most certainly need to speak to and make sure we get blessings from as far as the different departments go. But sometimes something's just like, we spent a very, very long day talking about this. Some things just you know, we just roll with. That's not to say the police are gonna have time to respond, they're not gonna respond to us saying somebody is out here, you know, trying to break in cars, if there's already a bunch of other shootings going on, they may not have the time to do that. But at bare minimum, we ourselves have residents, you know, we got this community policing thing going on, we got our ring cameras, we got our cell phones, let's go record this, let's be anonymous, by doing it, we're not getting hurt, and you know, protect ourselves. And then we got something to lock them up when the police finally gets time where we can tell them that, hey, we we we sing this person do this, it is something that is persecuted. We don't know how to go on the circuit attorney's office. But if enough of these starts to happen, and residents are being proactive, you know, the I believe the circuit attorney's office in other institutions will work with us because it's something that gets those people who are low level offenders because this is a low level thing. We can help get them the resources as may be needed, like Alderman Todd said before they become high level offenders. So with that, I'll yield I appreciate the effort. Alderman Oldenburg definitely took the time to have some conversation and to move some things around within the bill. So it isn't as are not meant to be the tip was never to be predatory. But it isn't. unpolished, if you will, hasn't had second thoughts for other people who has had different ideas on what could or would happen. I myself have gotten in a car accident, but I didn't get in three. accident. No way. I'm getting in three different cars back to back to back that aren't mine. So thank you.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:48:33
All right. Thank you, alderman. alderman narayen. Your hand has still been up? I don't know if you forgot to take. It should not be up. I will not read. I apologize. That's what I figured. So we have the old one from the eighth. 

Annie Rice, 8th ward Alderwoman  1:48:50
Thank you, Mr. President. And thank you members of the board. If the alderman from the 16th would yield for questions from 16. To dollar one for me. Well, all information, please proceed. Thank you, alderman. You know, I'm sure you're shocked to be hearing from me right now on this bill. I, I aye. I am. So I guess I'm still concerned. I listened to the testimony at the public safety committee hearing. And I you know, I do like that you've made some amendments to this bill. And my concern is still that there, there's an opportunity to trap some folks here that we're not intending to get to. And so what I, you know, we're, as a, you know, as a society, we're trying to work towards, you know, decriminalization of lower level offenses so that we're not trapping young folks and people who are at risk in a criminal justice system, you know, in a cycle of criminal justice involvement that we can then extricate them from So I'm wondering, you know, you said that your goal here is to, you know, knowing that our police department is is strapped for time and resources, that one of your goals here is to gather data. So I'm wondering if they're, you know, if the goal is to gather data, then why not drop the penalties and not make it a crime, but make it something that we can just be monitoring for? I don't know. Alderwoman. I

Tom Oldenburg, Alderman ward 16  1:50:29
think it's the mark of a society to make a goal statement about what's right and

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:50:36
wrong. Would you like the alderman from the 16? Oh, sorry. Oh, there you go. I'm sorry. My video keeps freezing. You just froze for a second. Proceed. Good.

Tom Oldenburg, Alderman ward 16  1:50:51
Thank you, Mr. Alderwoman. I mean, I certainly understand the position from which you're coming. I think it's important, though, to for laws to have teeth. And and I think it's the mark of a society that says, Yeah, there is going to be some form of punishment involved in a situation where you are breaking the law. I guess I'm sensitive to the topic of decriminalizing. But But, you know, at this point, I don't think I would entertain dropping any of the any of the provisions in the violations at this point. Okay. Um,

Annie Rice, 8th ward Alderwoman  1:51:39
so is there I looking at the, you know, the definition of successive, and I, I do also like that, you're, you're working to try to make that more specific. But I think the legislative intent, when you're defining it can be different from the commonly understood intent from neighbors that are seeing something that they don't recognize, you know, in the middle of the street, whether they're checking their own car, they get lost at somebody else's car, like me, they don't have a key fob, so they actually physically have to touch cars. And, and, you know, or they've got the handles that you have

Sharita Rogers, Clerk  1:52:10
to pull in, that's what unlocks it. Is,

Annie Rice, 8th ward Alderwoman  1:52:14
was there any? Was there any thought to actually numbering what successive would mean? So, you know, three or more doors to, you know, like, it's, it's bumping into a car that looks like yours, if you're not paying attention, if you're on your phone, or whatever, trying the handles of something, that that is pretty common. But you know, three or more in a row, you're probably not gonna have three cars that look like yours in a row, is there a way to even more so narrow this so that the people that we're neighbors that we're dealing with, we're, we're not increasing number of calls for situations that wouldn't otherwise be warranted?

Tom Oldenburg, Alderman ward 16  1:52:51
I mean, I, I would consider that I think that that takes I think it gets tricky. That the point of successive is you you kind of know what attempted car larceny is, or you don't? If that's important to you, and I could get you to sign on as a co sponsor to this, I probably support a number of cars, and limited to a number.

Annie Rice, 8th ward Alderwoman  1:53:19
I think, given that I will probably not be signing on to this as a co sponsor, but I do think it would be helpful to number that so that we're when we're communicating this back to residents who are concerned, you know, break ins are happening, you know, eighth word as well. And I know that folks are really frustrated with this. But, you know, when you're communicating a new, a new ordinance violation out to the public, you know, I think kind of the same way that you know, when it used to be when you reported something on nexport, next door, you saw something suspicious, there were a lot of really bad situations that happened where someone, you know, said, I, I see a black person walking down the alley, I'm not sure what's happening here, or I see someone walking down the street, and speaking from the experience of the neighborhoods that I represent, that happened a lot. And so what next door did was say, all right, give us some more information. You know, give us an actual description. Give us more information there so that we're not just racially profiling, right. So the more we're able to be specific about what it is that we're saying, the more we're better at communicating with our residents about what things are and we're not unintentionally trapping people.

Tom Oldenburg, Alderman ward 16  1:54:29
Sure, so by limited to three cars, you'll vote yes. 

Annie Rice, 8th ward Alderwoman  1:54:33
I will much more strongly consider voting yes. 

Tom Oldenburg, Alderman ward 16  1:54:37
Wow. That's a great compromiser you are let me say that.

Annie Rice, 8th ward Alderwoman  1:54:43
 All right. Thank you, Alderman. I appreciate that conversation. Mr. President and members of the board. I I would also like to hear from the Public Safety Department on this. I think there are a number of concerns here. You know, we it is it is a significant nuisance, for the People of our city to have cars rummage through, you know, folks are looking for guns. They're looking for money they're looking for, you know, things that are a value in people's cars. And it's frustrating. It's frustrating as a part of the city. But I don't, I don't want to contribute to further criminalizing people in our city if there are other ways that we can gather data that we're looking for, or prevent these things from happening. So thank you.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:55:26
Thank you. All the one from the other one from the 14th.

Carol Howard, 14th ward Alderwoman  1:55:43
Yes, alderman well, alderman from the 16th yield for questions.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:55:49
Coming from the 16th to the one from 14.

Carol Howard, 14th ward Alderwoman  1:55:53
I will thank you 

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:55:54
all one from 

Carol Howard, 14th ward Alderwoman  1:55:56
Okay, can I go ahead? Alderman Oldenburg. Help me here cuz, you know,

Sharita Rogers, Clerk  1:56:05
I'm tired. It's late.

Carol Howard, 14th ward Alderwoman  1:56:06
We're all a little tired. You did mention something about there already being a state statute to this effect is that

Tom Oldenburg, Alderman ward 16  1:56:18
what I what I mentioned is that there is a state statute around attempted larceny or attempted burglary, which of course is defined on you know, the guilt of the events being based on him commit an offense, ie, our auto larceny. However, it's not it's not specifically defined for what we see here, I think in our city, which is the offense of just going through, you know. Okay, my point here was to to really get more specific on attempted larceny or attempted auto arson.

Carol Howard, 14th ward Alderwoman  1:57:02
And I appreciate that. I think it's, it is problematic. And I think that, along with that, we're asking for a little more vigilance on the behalf of the St. Louis police department in responding to these type of calls.

Tom Oldenburg, Alderman ward 16  1:57:18
Is that true? That is correct. That's correct. Or some some response back instead of in the middle of the hearing four weeks after the end query from to the public safety director and the chief. So that's disheartening. So I you know, but I understand some people's positions may lie on Well, I want to hear from them first.

Carol Howard, 14th ward Alderwoman  1:57:41
That's fair. Um, I just wanted clarity on that. And I just think that sometimes we need to demand a little more to get a little more. Otherwise, we get what we get when we get it. So I appreciate this. And I rise in support of this. Thank you very much. That's all I have. Mr. President.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:57:59
Thank you all the woman all my first probably 16. Could you fuss Okay, could you please add me as a co sponsor? That was Bill. Thank you, alderman from this all alderman from the seventh.

Jack Coatar, 7th ward Alderman  1:58:20
Thank you, Mr. President, members of the board, Rice in support of the alderman from the 16th. Bill. I appreciate the thoughtful debate we've had I think it's interesting. You know, some of my colleagues seem very worried about further criminalization. I mean, this is this is an issue that plagues our city. While it's not the most serious of crimes in the long grand scheme of things, a car breaking doesn't sound like it. But what's the reason people break into cars nowadays, and I even the Alderwoman, from the eighth alluded to this, she wouldn't commit to actually supporting the bill, with some some amount further amendments. But breaking into cars in nowadays is done for two reasons to steal the car or for weapons. And I'm pretty sure we know that basically in about breaking into 10 vehicles in the city of St. Louis. And in doing so you're going to get somewhere between one and two guns out of those 10 vehicles, and those are the street value and those are used in furtherance of of other crimes. You know, I think last I checked on the only member of this board, but then he sort of experience as a prosecutor or charging anyone with crimes. What are the laws in the state of Missouri and I can say that it's extremely difficult to do so. In the scenario that the alderman from the 16th is hoping to legislate, attempted stealing, attempted tampering with motor vehicle and second degree are very difficult to prove any attempt crimes are hard to approve. But in modern times, this is not something that would be used. I can't imagine any law enforcement agency would be saying if you accidentally hit one car door. And it's the wrong car, which is, I guess the experience of the alderman for the 18th Ward that he had in his car in his comments earlier. That's not what we're looking at here. This is for folks who are going down a block of cars, looking for open car doors, looking for guns, looking for money or looking to steal a vehicle. We don't have really an adequate state law to handle this. And this is kind of a unique problem with the city of St. Louis. And I speak to this as the alderman for the seventh Ward, who I'll leave last year out of the equation COVID in 2020, but in 2019, I believe I had close to 800 car break ins in the downtown neighborhood alone 800. And that was down 20% from the year before, because we caught a major ring of of folks committing car break ins. So as someone who represents a district that averages close, you know, over 800 car break ins a year pre COVID. In these are crimes that mainly impact, you know, tourists and visitors to downtown. This is something that I think would be helpful. Is it going to cure all that ails us? No, definitely not. But I think it's something that would be a useful tool. And I'll end with I guess, we got an email from the public safety director who I have the utmost respect for. But to get an email at, you know, I don't even know what time it is 10pm, it was 8pm or 7pm. When that happened, when we've been going at this all day, and this has been on the calendar and up for debate for weeks and weeks for in the I'm not going to call it the 11th hour, I'll call the 27th hour to get an email saying Oh, we got to talk about this further. I just think it's crazy. And I think it's a symptom of what we're dealing with right now. And the reason we're having this long meeting is the lack of communication from this administration on issues whether it's for bill to committee substitute as amended, or other legislation, they seem to show of sort of an indifference for the legislative process until they realize, Oh, this is actually happening, and it's going to impact us and our agenda. It's tired, I'm tired, it's late, we're all ready to call this quits. I'd like to be added as a co sponsor, and I fully support your bill, alderman.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  2:02:15
Thank you, alderman from the seventh all the Alderwoman from the 19th. Your hand was up in it went down. 

Marlene Davis, Alderwoman ward 19  2:02:23
So I would like to be added as a co sponsor of the bill. And just and just briefly say that it's important for people to be able to get a report number for insurance purposes, it doesn't mean that the police are going to use any extra time to come to the scene or anything like that. But they do need a police report. And we've done that on the 911 priority list. As most of you know, there are a lot of reasons why the police don't show up, but you get a report number. Thank you, Mr. President.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  2:02:55
Thank you, Madam Clerk, please make note of that element from the 22nd.

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  2:03:01
Thank you, Mr. President, members of board. You know, sometimes I wonder if we as a body is teetering on lunacy. I'm not going to apologize for the fact that I am pro victim. I'm not pro criminal. And it seems like we're always looking for ways to save the criminals from themselves. We have colleagues that don't believe and cameras. But imagine if you had surveillance camera on a street, Washington Avenue downtown, for example. And you see people moving down the street checking people car doors, and eventually they may even break into somebody's car where you can dispatch a police officer. And then you can make an arrest. They're not checking car doors because they just want to make sure that the car is unlocked and they can lock it on behalf of the owner. That's not what they're doing. They're checking car doors because they want to steal something like the alderman from the seventh Ward said a look about guns. They look at whatever they can. And in my neighborhood, you know, innocent people have been victims for leaving their car unlocked and they come out and it's been ransacked and they take stuff from it. Um, can you imagine? You know that you live in a really, really nice neighborhood. And people are going around checking your front doors and your back doors. What do you do? Oh, they didn't mean anything by it. They just checking to see if the homeowner lock their door so they can lock it home. That's not what they're doing. It's a nefarious act that they're committed and they need to pay a penalty forward. I don't know why we got it. We get into this con candy hand holding pro criminal space. I don't get it. People need to pay consequences for their nefarious behavior. And I don't want to hear I don't want to keep hearing Oh, they're poor. So we're going to use that as an excuse because we can't keep using that excuse over and over again. I am totally in support. This bill, I want to be down as a co sponsor. And I really wish that we create some type of paradigm shift within our body as a whole, that we start caring more about victims than we do. criminalists. Thank you, Mr. President.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  2:05:13
Thank you. I'm tired too. We have alderman from the 23rd. And all the one from 13. So Oh, one from 13. I believe you may have been first and then alderman from 23rd. Right after.

Anne Schweitzer, 13th Ward Alderwoman  2:05:31
Thank you so much, Mr. President, members of the board. I'm sure a lot of you are probably expecting me to be a no vote on this. And I gotta be honest, the all I'm just boomeranging back and forth. In my head. I hear a lot from constituents about these sorts of activities happening, of course, illegal, you know, people are trying to break into other people's cars. I mean, that's attempted that if it's legal, you know, simultaneously we have issues of police not responding to this sort of call. I don't I don't know if this is going to do anything or not. Or if it's, I have no idea. I mean, I I have no idea. And I you know, I am going to be a present today just because, you know, even though I I hear what the alderman from the 16th to saying about not getting a timely response, and that is so frustrating, and I'm very sorry that that was your experience. Because Yeah, I mean, I think we're all sick of this 27th hour I thought that was well said stuff. And so I appreciate that I'm gonna be present today. I could be swayed either way if anyone wants to try. And I appreciate the time that everyone's taken to give their opinions.

Joe Vaccaro, 23rd ward Alderman  2:06:44
Right alderman from the 23rd mine simple. I just want to make sure I'm added as a co sponsor. I wouldn't give a two hour dissertation on why, but it's already cutting into my bedtime.

Carol Howard, 14th ward Alderwoman  2:07:11
I forgot when I was speaking I wanted to be added as a co sponsor. Also, I think this is probably a good step in the right direction and and defending our taxpayers against some of the criminal element out there. Thank you.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  2:07:23

Tom Oldenburg, Alderman ward 16  2:08:56
Thank you, Mr. President, I appreciate the discussion. I appreciate the co sponsors, what I might say is that anyone's on the fence here, during during roll call, go into the Google folder and there is a video in there of exactly what we're talking about, that I placed in there that you can click on. And I think this is this is a good response to set it set it a statement about the when we're not going to tolerate this as a city. And this brings fear into our residents. And I'm not fear mongering here. But this is a prudent, you know, proportional response that hopefully rattles the cage a little bit of the public safety director's office and his police department that this is a concern of residents and they don't want to be told to just lock their door. We tried to do that. But you should. Like I mentioned earlier, you should be able to be forgetful and still feel safe. And this isn't a ball sense of security This is saying I think we can really you know formulate a strategy around this and you know hopefully drive drive those folks out of the city, quite honestly. So feel free to take a look at that video if you want to do with that Mr. President, I renew my most.

for questions on the president yield for questions and alderman from the 22nd 22nd. Please proceed. Armando, can

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  2:18:21
you tell us what's great and exciting about your board bill?

Tina "Sweet T" Pihl, 17th ward Alderwoman  2:18:24
Regarding this? Okay, I have a question.

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  2:18:34
Okay, take your time. It's okay. Yeah, I

Tina "Sweet T" Pihl, 17th ward Alderwoman  2:18:36
have a question. Are we able to combine these three, four bills because they are one legislation?

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  2:18:42
They have to be handled separately.

Tina "Sweet T" Pihl, 17th ward Alderwoman  2:18:45
Okay. All right. Alderman Boyd, can you repeat your question?

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  2:18:55
No, I just thought you might want to share the good news about what's going on in your ward as it relates to the board bill.

Tina "Sweet T" Pihl, 17th ward Alderwoman  2:19:03
so forth, Bill 71 is the founder or the developer new and found is trying to get approved reapproved for the tip that they received in 2018, the tax increment financing. And what is really special about, I believe all these four bills and support from you all regarding this approval of this tip is that this tip has already been debated and approved. It first was approved in 2018. And then it was again approved with the redevelopment plan change. And now it has come up a third time at this point in time because the developer has changed its redevelopment plan due to COVID. And so what I believe in terms of this whole package is that what is great about this is that we will be getting more from this tip if it's approved than we did in the past. There's a $1.8 million equitable development contribution from the developer that has been added to this tip.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  2:20:27
Right thank alderman for the 22nd. It's 921.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  2:28:59
all all the ones from 17 directly recognized on protection of board Bill 73.

Tina "Sweet T" Pihl, 17th ward Alderwoman  2:29:06
Perfect board Bill 73. Thank you.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  2:29:11
Second discussion, following from the 22nd sure Mr. President was more with the auto from the 17th to columns and 17. Leo? Yes, I do. Sure. I want Can you explain to us, you know, no.

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  2:29:32
the merits of this bill and why it was so important to you to pass this bill.

Tina "Sweet T" Pihl, 17th ward Alderwoman  2:29:42
Yes, thank you. So, in terms of this tip, Bill, it was something that was already passed. I felt that you know, it was already passed twice. And so I have thought that we needed to do something better in terms of giving more to the city for to pass again. And so what is added in for Bill 73 is the equitable development contribution that the developer will be giving to the city, it will be housed in the Affordable Housing Trust Fund. And it's going to be $1.8 million, it's 10% of the $18 million tip they're going to get. And this money is going to go to affordable housing repair 50% of the funds will be going to the north side of Del Mar, and 50% of the funds will be going towards 70. Every word 17 does not use those funds, within five years, the remaining balance of those funds will be able to be used in north of Del Mar. And so what this does is that, unlike other tips, this $1.8 million to epilobium development contribution, it's going to directly impact citizens now versus later. Because this tip, like most of the tips here in the city of St. Louis, it's 23 years. So we need to get this money into the hands of individuals who are looking, they're getting displaced, you know, COVID is here. And so we needed individuals to be able to repair their homes now. So they don't get displaced, and they stay in their homes. Also, at the same time, making sure that homes are stable. It will help in terms of the schoolchildren, and in terms of them being able to have a healthy and safe home. And so it also benefits in terms of schools, to school children to be able to go to school and not have to worry about their housing. Right.

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  2:32:04
And if I remember a committee, so and I really appreciate the hard work that went into this by yourself, the developer in the administration, but what happened was that the city actually increased the amount of incentives by this project to get a much better project. And as Mr. Pfeffer said, Director of Development and policy for the mayor, that it's actually the percentage of incentives is smaller than original package, which is true. But the project grew by what $90 million, or something like that. Is that right?

Tina "Sweet T" Pihl, 17th ward Alderwoman  2:32:44
Yeah. Yes, a million dollars.

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  2:32:47
Yeah. And so what you were able to do and skillful negotiating is to get $1.8 million up front, not having to stretch it out over 23 years over the life of the TIF, but to get it up front right away, so that half of that could go to the 17th the boundaries of the current 17th. Ward, and the rest of it could go throughout the city, right.

Tina "Sweet T" Pihl, 17th ward Alderwoman  2:33:16
Go to the north side of

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  2:33:19
the nightside, specifically focusing on that. Okay. And so I thought, first of all, I thought that was a great deal, at the end of the day. But what I want to point out is that this is a consistent with the messaging of room 200. And, but I appreciate it, and I'm supportive of it. And, you know, as we respect each other as older people in our respective wards, and we do our due diligence, to vet projects, and we come to a compromise with the developer, the expectation, and what we call automatic courtesy was there, some automated don't appreciate automatic courtesy. And I understand and I get that. But I think there's merit to automatic courtesy, because I as your colleague, I want you to be as successful as you can be because you represent a ward that didn't vote for me. And you have to satisfy the constituents of your ward. And so I'm only saying this and wanting you to share this with the universe, because there's all this noise about how we over incentivize, and this all this corporate welfare, and so on and so forth. But when you look at the phenomenal work that the developer has done in that space over there in the 17th Ward, I think there's a lot of merit to what you did. And I appreciate it, and I congratulate you and I salute you on that. And I also say all that to ask you and other colleagues that support that narrative about corporate welfare to be Be more sensitive to colleagues like me and other colleagues downtown or wherever it may be, so that when we vet people and your other colleagues, vet people, and we feel like we did i do diligence, that you will give us the same fair consideration. Because I think I speak on behalf of all my colleagues when I say we want everybody to be successful. And I certainly want you to be successful in this project, which is a major deal for a brand new alderman, basically, that really have talked about as synonyms. Were incentivizing developers too much. I mean, that was part of your platform. But you found yourself in a situation whereby you have to sit on your hands a little bit. And you have to say, Hmm, maybe I didn't know what I didn't know. Because now that I know, it makes more sense to be more supportive of these incentives, even though they look like a huge amount of success and setups. But as Mr. backer says, this huge What is it? 2 million? Correct? $1.8 million? How much? $1.8 million? Are you talking about? The project? I'm sorry, the whole project? I'm sorry? Are you talking about the tip, specifically, the total product development?

Thank you. For the ball there, man. This was mean a deal, you know, in terms of just coming aboard, and looking at it. And this is something that I've been thinking about for a long time as a planner. And one of the things I'm going to continue to do is look at best practices that I've seen, and that I've experienced for the last 20 years. And as some of you know, this came about because what I saw when I was in Boston and the linkage fund, and they have been doing it since 1986. And they were just the sleepy town of Boston at that point in time. And so I've seen that this type of collaboration with the developer to create either affordable housing a home repair is the way to strengthen cities

So I just want to acknowledge a lot of the work and effort that my neighbors have put into beautification along the Virginia Avenue corridor. The dutchtown said and other partners this week started painting the light posts. As many of you guys are familiar, we've got those Cobra head lights all over the city. They're just running dutchtown as they are anywhere else. But the said and other neighborhood organizations have been working to get them all painted along the Virginia corridor, and also replacing signage and updating them and really trying to bring that corridor back to life. So really want to drive that corridor almost every day or walk by it or bike around. And it's, it's nice to see more activity and more beautification efforts taking place. And I just want to acknowledge that and thank all of my effort. And actually, Mr. President, Michael powers, formerly of your office has been involved with that effort as well. So kudos to him and, you know, his time and energy and that endeavor as well.

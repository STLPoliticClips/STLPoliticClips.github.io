Shameem Clark-Hubbard, Alderwoman ward 26: Yes I spoke about having every tool in the tool box, but after learning more we know more and learn more. You know better, you do better. I just feel like wholeheartedly this is the answer, this is not the answer. Telling victims that this crime plane will solve crimes that happened in the past is not the answer. Scaring our people and scaring our communities into this is not the answer. 

I was really encouraged by the program mentioned that the brothers in Baltimore talked about with the Ring cameras. Actually, we kind of did a little bit of that in the 26th ward with the 5th district police department and it worked out great.

When you have control over the surveillance and when you know where it is and you can use it and go right to it, yes that makes a difference. When it’s just something that you just pulling out or when you can pull it out not knowing when you can pull it out. Then if the tool stops there, what do we do with it? If the tool was not used the police department, the tool is not used by the public safety direct, the tool is not used by the circuit attorney office, they’re the people that are supposed to work in concert to combat violent crime in the city, then is it really gonna be impactful? Is it gonna help?

The one thing I will say that was said, and I cant remember who said it, but I know the whole “free”, but nothing is free. If you wanna talk about free, like who's paying for this or whoever. Someone said, I can't remember, but I encourage those dollars, if they can be used somewhere else, then use them somewhere else. Put em on the ground. Put em in the programs that are already in place that have some programs with measurable outcomes, things that used to work that we don’t do anymore like the gang units that Rodney Robinson used to do.

Things like that, that worked and were dismantled for whatever reason before I got here. But, I just know that, throwing it out in the wind like this, and it’s kind of irony because it’s an airplane, to me, it doesn’t sit well 100% on my heart. But, if it’s passes through, and I’m in this position for however long I am, I am going to work to make it work just like I fought for Cure Violence when people were against Cure Violence, just like anything else. 

Alderman Oldenburg knows this, so with that, that’s just my little two cents on it but I could not be settled here just saying I am in full support of BB200.

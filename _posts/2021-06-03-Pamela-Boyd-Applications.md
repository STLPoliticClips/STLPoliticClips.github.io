Pamela Boyd, Alderwoman ward 28: I guess my frustration is and I'm saying what other other people have probably are frustrated too. We get calls to say send us people we need people. And I can give one case scenario. 

I got calls. You know, we need people in forestry, we need people in parks and so I'm telling my constituents, they need staff. We do the applications, we take them down there and you lose them. You didn't lose on why she lost her three times. 

After the third time, I told them, I'm too embarrassed to keep asking people to fill out applications. They were like, they can go online... Well, everybody can't go online. I'm sorry. Everybody hasn't gotten up to that point. 

So I think what I keep hearing is the frustration from constituents are that you all have the jobs online, people that do apply online, they get a generated letter that says automatically, you're not qualified, or you are on the list, and they never hear. So, we just feel like we're just spinning our wheels. 

So, you know, I'm embarrassed to tell people they need help that you are, we need help, because it seems like when people -- when we push it, we can't get people hired. So when I talk to forestry, and they say they 30 people down. That's heartbreaking to me, because that's telling me that's 30 positions that we can't get services to our community, because we don't have the manpower.

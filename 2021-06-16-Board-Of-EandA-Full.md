Tishaura Jones, Mayor  09:26
Um before we move forward, can I get a brief update on where we are with board bill one with a budget?

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  09:38
Well, board bill one has nothing to do with these three items. If you would like to, for us to do an update on board bill one or give you an update on board bill one. But it has nothing that is not germane to items 9, 10 and 11. So if you want to, we can make emotional 910 11 and then Give me an update on board.

Tishaura Jones, Mayor  10:02
I was hopeful that we'd be further along with board bill one by now. And would love to get a quick update if you can provide one.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  10:14
I will, I'll give you an update. But we still have items on the agenda before us.

Tishaura Jones, Mayor  10:22
I would like to move to table items nine through 11. Is there a second? 

Darlene Green, Comptroller  10:28
Second. 

Tishaura Jones, Mayor  10:30

Stephanie Green, Clerk  10:42
I'm sorry. Mayor Jones, 

Tishaura Jones, Mayor  10:44
I 

Stephanie Green, Clerk  10:45
Comptroller green 

Darlene Green, Comptroller  10:46
Aye. 

Stephanie Green, Clerk  10:47
President Reed?

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  10:48
No, because bi-state needs the money. But we can if you guys want to play with public transportation play with it.  I'm pretty sure that we're all having Oh, I

Darlene Green, Comptroller  10:59
had I wanted to ask a president read as I look at items 9, 10 and 11. I see fiscal 22. Does that mean that these funds are for the next year's fiscal year budget for bi state? No, mean it's a question yes or no? Is this for next year? Is this for any part of this year

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  11:20
it's for the upcoming fiscal year?

Darlene Green, Comptroller  11:23
Thank you for that. I have no further questions.  I just know that the city of St. Louis has an upcoming fiscal 2022 budget as well. And I do believe that we can work this out so that all funding can be done. As in the past, you know, we would not ever had an issue where we're funding an agency outside of the city of St. Louis, Madam Mayor, and not funding the city of St. Louis at the same time. So any citizen with their taxes that they pay to the city of St. Louis would understand that we would want to fund the city of St. Louis in order to deliver their city services to them, you know, pick up the trash, you know, fill potholes, those kinds of things, as well as fund bi-state in a timely fashion. So it appears that we'll table these until such time that we can do the proper funding for the city and bi-state. Mr. President, do you have problem with that?

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  12:24
I'm fine with how--- 

Darlene Green, Comptroller  12:25
Thank you Mr. President I really appreciate it, Madam Mayor, [inaudible cross-talk] 

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  12:30
I'll help out. I'll have my say. So please, go ahead. 

Darlene Green, Comptroller  12:35
Thank you.

Tishaura Jones, Mayor  12:38
Yes, I agree with the comptroller, you know, we thought that we'd be further along with board Bill one by this time. And we can schedule a special ed and a meeting for next week. If we need to, but we need to make sure that as the comptroller so eloquently put it, we need to take care of home first.

Darlene Green, Comptroller  12:59
Madam Mayor, I am available for a special meeting next week if need be. 

Tishaura Jones, Mayor  13:04
So am I.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  13:06
That's good. That's good to know.  Well, anyway, um, first off, we the city will have a budget July one, because the budget that E&A has already approved will go into effect on July one. So if you all had a problem with the budget, that will go into effect, you should have made your votes apparent when you both voted on it earlier when we passed it out of E and A. 

Darlene Green, Comptroller  13:31
So, Mr. President, I don't understand. Could you be more clear,

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  13:35
 the budget that was sent to the to the Board of Aldermen from EA, if the Board of Aldermen does not pass that budget by July one, that budget that we sent from the E and A that both of you voted on will come will become law, July one with no further action. So that is what is getting ready to happen. So you all you all had a problem with the budget that both of y'all created shouldn't have said something earlier. So that's the budget that's going to go into effect July one. If you want to hold up by state for the neck. I

Darlene Green, Comptroller  14:09
didn't even understand that. Exactly. I'm really unclear. It appears that you when you say it to the mayor, that you are going to respond about the letter that she sent about board bill one when you were going to do that. Now you're saying publicly and correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounds like you're saying you're not gonna respond to that, because what we approved May as of May one, moving it over to the Board of Aldermen, you're not going to touch that and what's going to go into effect is what the board of ama sent over to the Board of Aldermen. In other words, that means that there will be no action taken by the Ways and Means Committee. In other words, getting a letter back as to whatever action that's what I think I heard you say but if you don't mind, a clarity would be helpful here.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  14:58
Okay to clarify We had an unprecedented action taken this budget year that I've never seen in my history where we voted on a budget with with revenue streams in that budget and one of the revenue streams were cut off. During the time the budget was being debated at the Board of Aldermen, the Board of Aldermen just happened upon it through questioning, we had no idea that we had been sent an unbalanced budget and had we moved forward and voted on that budget, the way it would have been would have stood we would have voted on it under false pretenses with the with with the belief that all of those revenue streams that we all agreed on. The mayor, you the comptroller, and myself all agreed on, should be part of the budget. When that one of those items were summarily dismissed and removed by our mayor. Now, we sent over a request to say that I thought was very nice because the board has an opportunity to cut things but I said it is not I don't think that the board should just make arbitrary cuts. I think that the mayor should tell us where she would like to have those things cut. Now we're sitting here tomorrow, we have one meeting than our our last meeting before the end of the month is next week. So we don't have ran out of time. We have to we have we have we have legal issues also within the Board of Aldermen that we have to follow in terms of adopting ordinances. Now, if both of you hope that both of you now have a problem with the budget that both of you voted on, I don't know what to tell you. You're gonna have to do some soul searching on that

16:39
just so confusing to me, Mr. President, because in 2019, I believe you and Madam Mayor Lyda krewson, at the time voted to 2019 budget out with the comptroller which is myself not present. So that budget voted out. And then last year as I finished I won't be long did you could take over but just a couple 30 seconds here. Last year's budget did not return after the Ways and Means brought it back to EA. This is the first year in my 25 years that the Ways and Means hasn't brought it back to EA and I think that's a huge issue. Because you've just identified an issue that the budget really needs to be handled. And for some reason, you've not pin that in a letter from the Ways and Means Committee instead, if I'm not mistaken. Mr. President, you sent a letter to the mayor, which is unprecedented letter should come back to the Board of E and A as the budget was sent from the Board of E&A. The board, the Board of BNA, sent the budget to eat to s to the Ways and Means Committee, not the mayor alone. So I don't understand why you're saying you have a problem with the budget that was voted on by all three of us, even though you may have voted no, it was still voted on by the board of estimate and apportionment. And so it does not matter. Because in 2019, when I did not vote, it didn't matter. And we passed a budget that was legal, and you're attempting to cause a problem. And from the words that I hear you're saying today that you have a problem sending that budget back to the to the Board of SVR portion to be legally correct. And is that what you're trying to do? actively knowing and stating here publicly today among all of us at the board of estimate a portion man and the public that you have a problem for letting the board of estimate apportionment correct it? You're not going to send that back? Is that what I'm hearing from you? And it will be stunning to know that you would move forward in that fashion.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  18:51
So it's stunning to me that you mentioned everything except for the fact that a major revenue stream was removed.

Darlene Green, Comptroller  19:06
Here give me a sounds like you're repeating yourself. We need to hear it. But we're trying to move forward. Mr. President, we heard you say that there was a stream of revenue. As a matter of fact, we can tell you from where it comes the criminal justice area. So can you please can you answer that question instead of repeating yourself? Well, to correct that, Mr. President of the border of St. Paul, you've been here for 12 years now as a 13. And have you

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  19:47
ever been here longer and y'all seen that as the Comptroller

Darlene Green, Comptroller  19:53
and you've not you've only repeated yourself a third time I don't understand why we have to rehab.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  20:06
From another repeat, why are you repeating yourself?

Darlene Green, Comptroller  20:10
I'm just trying to get clarity and you're not answering the question. We already know, the board members if you did not bother me in the letter. What is your problem that you don't want them to know about? They just don't get it. Mr. President, what is your problem?

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  20:41
My problem is that we have a revenue stream that was on the budget. And it was irresponsible to do that with a budget that was already passed from the Board of VNA. Now, if that's going to be a new practice, that's going to be a new practice. I'm not going to take part in that. Not sure what you're talking about from 2019. But last year, if you remember, last year is all the way through. Or you speak at the same time, you're right, let me give me an opportunity. Now give me an opportunity to speak. All right. So you continue to you continue to point out something that happened in 2019. completely unrelated, because you cannot point out through your history here in the city of St. Louis. Were you a correctly? Are you gonna allow me to finish? We're not gonna lie, but you can tell us because you understand that you

Darlene Green, Comptroller  21:44
have, you have to understand the official 2022. But you want to take us where you want to make me. I'm gonna take my test. Now, when you take us down, you're not gonna allow me to speak? No. Because if you don't tell me what I remembered what I don't remember, that's what you cannot do. You're not gonna say what you remember. You can say what you recall. And you can say what you're not. You speak on my behalf

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  22:28
for about one other time in history, exactly like you are, I can speak for myself, do not be quiet for yourself. Now, this city, not for the city. One other time where you've seen that happen. I'm just saying that I haven't seen it happen. Now. If you can, if you if you've had that happen multiple times, let me know. I've never seen it happen. So now we're in a unique situation. We also are here in the state of Missouri, where we are required to pass the balanced budget, we by law, we have to do that the Board of Aldermen cannot vote on an unbalanced budget. And board bill number one is a board bill that My name is on. And I'm telling you I'm not gonna I'm not going to take that before the full Board of Aldermen, which is why I sent a letter asking for cuts to be identified. Right? Everybody seems to be upset about that. But guess what, you wouldn't have to identify any cuts, had you not removed a major revenue stream from the budget, we wouldn't even be having this conversation. So let's be clear. It's not me that's causing this conversation is the cutting of over five and a half million dollars from the budget without discussions amongst other members that are involved in that or even the entire Ways and Means Committee, or the Board of Aldermen. where we are, we are a separate branch of government all independently elected just like everybody else here at the board of E and A. So please respect that we also have a job to do. And don't ask us to do something that's inappropriate because we will not do it more. Bill number one has my name on it. And I'm telling you right now, if you identify the cuts, the Board of Aldermen has to pass the power by the charter to do what cuts we can cut. So give us the cuts we would we were going to put them in the budget and move the thing. But now we have not we burned up a little bit of time we have and we have exactly one more meeting pass tomorrow the Board of Aldermen and we're out again, but instead of instead of addressing the issue directly, you all want to hold up on the by state funding which was to me do it hold it up for the next 10 years, but you're gonna have to, you're gonna have to explain to people why the public transit system in the city of St. Louis stop is going to be because of petty stuff that's happening on this board again, a and man, but you all agree items 910 and

Tishaura Jones, Mayor  25:16
11. president president read, no one's-- the bi-state funding will not stop because of what we did today. I sent you a letter on Monday identifying additional revenue sources to make up the gap that was identified because of our not taking federal prisoners anymore. And all we have to do all we have to do is bring the budget back to the Board of E&A, and we will make the revenue additions.

Darlene Green, Comptroller  25:44
Madam Mayor, thank you. That is what I was trying to get your attention because I did get a copy of your letter, Madam Mayor, where you are responding to the president of the board's letter. However, I did not receive a copy of the letter from him. He has mentioned that the Board of Aldermen can cut, of course, we do know that all of the board of estimate enforcement members know that. He's also mentioning the schedule for the board of aldermen and we're all aware of the current schedule for the Board of Aldermen. But Madam Mayor, if I may, I believe that you're pointing out and I'm agreeing with you is that instead of identifying cuts, you've identified revenue, and that you would like to have those revenues added to the budget, so that the the budget can be balanced. And I am not hearing any help from the president of the board. And in past, we have had issues where we have needed to add revenues to the budget. And we have had the same President of the Board of Aldermen, who's here now agree with past mayors. That would have been passed Mayor Lyda Krewson, past Mayor Francis Slay so I don't understand. Well, of course, I've been the controller during that time that this President, this president or board is not allowing the Ways and Means Committee to send the budget back to the Board of estimate and apportionment to air revenues. Instead, he wants to take us through this on today. And today's meeting to make the public believe that the only thing that can be done is cuts. And I just think that's so sad that he's trying to throw a blame off on two individuals that's trying to move the city forward.  And he's talking really, in a negative manner, which is unnecessary. But I do want to also mention the board bill two, which is the National relief funding that is so important in and we've had no action from your request from the president of the board, who again, is saying that we're out of time, I would hope that if he can remember last year special meetings, when the Board of Aldermen requested that the Board of estimate apportionment have several special meetings as well as the Board of Aldermen when they were trying to privatize the airport and close the workhouse. So I do know that special meetings, especially at this time of the year, not only is possible, but absolutely necessary is the president of borders is mentioning, we have an issue. So Madam Mayor, I'm with you. I believe in the solution that you're talking about. I believe it's a viable solution. So, Mr. President, once again, what's the problem?

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  29:01
a cursory review of the charter and state laws will tell you what the problem is. And not to mention the fact that the only way we found out about the missing stream of revenue was through exhaustive questioning. So I'm not sure about some of the other things in that budget. Again, my name is on that budget, neither one of your all names on that budget. So or if other revenue streams are gonna be missing or change within within that budget. So here's what we're gonna do the budget. That is right now before the board before the bottom of alderman in committee, my my bill, right, unfortunately, is my deal. As the president and board member of E&A is my bill. Again, unfortunately, given the fact that it has a $5.7 million mysterious hole in it that that is didn't know existed, right? That bill isn't going anywhere, what will happen is that the budget that was passed before E and a will go into effect, we're going to introduce another bill that will have the additions, deletions, cuts, or whatever else you want to put in there in there, along with making sure that we have a review of the budget to make sure all those revenue streams that were that existed in the thing is still there. So so that's what's gonna happen. That happens, that happens. without extra meetings, that happens without any of this stuff that you're talking about. Right? The budget that we sent over to the board of alderman, will go into effect on July one. So you can't say it's going to impact the residents of the city of people at all, it impacts them nothing at all, because it automatically goes to effect. We're gonna fix it with another bill that we will another appropriations bill that we will introduce that will give us ample time to review and assure that we plugged every hole and every problem in this budget. That's what we're going to do. And no amount of talking nor amount of twisting the words or changing around the subject matters or hiding, what truly happened is going to change that you know why? Because my name is on the bill. I'm the primary sponsor of the bill. And I'm telling you, on categorically right now, that there is nothing that you all are gonna say, to make me move forward with a bill that you all somehow mysteriously put a $5.7 million hole in, and didn't tell him, and then we had to find out through question at the ways and means that all of a sudden, this bill has a $5.7 million hole. And so forgive me for not having a lot of faith in the fact that somehow I'm gonna send this thing back it's gonna get right. And I'm like, I don't have to ask any questions moving forward. I'm sorry, that is not happening. So another bill will be introduced, that will allow us for ample time to review and to make sure that the preparations is correct. But again, if you guys want to hold the $41 million up for public transportation, hold it up till this time next year.

Tishaura Jones, Mayor  32:25
There is a week. So are we to assume that you're going to have special meetings in order to get this supplemental bill passed before the

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  32:33
bill does not. And I'm sorry for cutting you off. Now.

Tishaura Jones, Mayor  32:38
I'm just I'm just trying to figure out the path forward here. You know, are you going to call a special meeting special meetings in order to get this supplemental bill passed, because we also have board bill too, that if not passed by July 1 is going to have a serious effect on people who are currently receiving rental assistance, they will fall through the cracks. We have funding in there for our use, and for you some of these jobs, which is a huge deterrent of crime with our young people, as well as utility assistance for our seniors and disabled. And so a more bill to also isn't passed before you recess. We all have hundreds or 1000s of St. Louis and falling through the cracks in the safety net.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  33:27
Well, you asked two questions there Yes, about barbell one barbell one, the supplemental appropriations bill, we can only introduce that at any time. Once we get through all of the different components of what actually would have to be in it. It does not affect four mill one going into effect the way it stands on board mill one would go into effect the way it stands, we will have a a nother board, board mill introduced to adjust and make any changes that we need to to that year's budget going forward. So that So essentially, the discussion on the budget for for the near term is over. So what we would be doing now is asking the the budget director to work with us to put together an appropriations bill that would include any additional changes that we would have to have in that New Year's in that new project that would start do I want. That's the cleanest, easiest way to do it. It gives us ample time to review everything to make sure that we're doing it correctly. Then, for the American Recovery Act funding we have we have roughly $8 million dollars sitting there going forward for rental assistance and mortgage assistance that that is still in the budget for right now. And it will be announced July one not the only parts that that would be missing. thing is the funds for the outside contractors to help us evaluate the applications. And the only reason those funds only reason those funds would be gone away is because the governor has not extended the deadline. But for me, I remember the board and all of that. And us, we found that out from y'all yesterday, that apparently the governor is not going to extend the deadline for you, it would have been good to know that 30 or 60 days ago, because we would have had time to make adjustments. Up until now. We were as narrow as you know, we were waiting to, for your outside of team to finish their evaluation for us to begin during our things at the border wall. If we were doing that, at the same time, we were doing the budget and and you all are listening outside information from people, I think that we would have been Crossing Paths and not understood where you were going with it. Now we know what your priorities are. So we have something to factor to and to put in a board bill with other things right that that may come up through our public discussions. But the board of all of those processes cannot be shortened by anything that happens within the executive branch and outside entities, we still have our public testimony that we have to do we have committee hearings that we have to do, and all of those things that have to be done at the Board of Aldermen in the legislative branch of government. So we're starting that process. We will have hearings next week on board bill number two to understand, Stan that he sent something over related the word November to I'll look at that and assure that that all the committee members and everybody has a copy of that. And we will begin that process. So but to say that everything is falling, because of for Bill number two, I guess the other thing is everybody pretty much knew when we were going down at the bord of alderman going and if everybody if the if the executive branch knew about this July deadline, and waited till two weeks before, before the end of June, to tell us that all of a sudden the world is gonna end if you guys don't do this in the next two weeks. I don't think that that's fair and equitable to the people in the city of St. Louis, let alone the members of the board that you're asking to try to jump through hoops to do something that's nearly impossible.

Darlene Green, Comptroller  37:43
Mayor, I am meeting next week, I think the President of what was finished. I'm so sorry. I thought you were finished talking about how you work with basically condemning the board of estimate an apportionment is a member and you are trying to make the difference between executive branch and the legislative branch in turn. Nothing is fine.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  38:18
Thanks for telling me

Darlene Green, Comptroller  38:21
that you've got to be ready at the Board of Aldermen, is what I'm hearing from you that you're not only going not going to be ready you're not going to participate in making sure that we run here for just making sure that the city revenue budget in a timely manner, because you just talked about hearings that you were going to start and I'm just stunned to hear that you're gonna have to release statements to the to the citizens then everybody just mind control, you are not paying attention to attention.

39:14
Remember, we had a unprecedented number of special meetings in the board of estimate apportionment and to accommodate the Board of Aldermen as well as special meetings at the Board of Aldermen so that you could get past what you had on your agenda item and what you wanted to be put forth which was to close the workhouse

Darlene Green, Comptroller  39:40
privatization of the airport and the Board of Ed each time so and that you've never heard of it before. It speaks louder.

39:57
No, I don't understand why you think we don't get you or why you feel like you've never heard this before. But it's sad to see you act in this manner with the new mayor and thinking that this is wool over our eyes. We get you Mr. President. 

Darlene Green, Comptroller  40:14
You just told us that you getting ready to slowdown in the city. And that is a sad commentary for someone with your experience, and what you're trying to put forth to the citizens. It's not going to play well, with with me as the comptroller and it's is not going to play well with the citizens at all. You're slowing us down. And that is shameful, Mr. President, that is shameful. You out to be ashamed that you're gonna slow down this city. Becayse your name is on the bill? [inaudible cross talk] shameful, shameful of you, shameful of you, shameful of you, shameful of you, you ought to be ashamed not to be ashamed revenues, cannot you? Are you in the meeting? Is that what you do? 

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  41:00
I'm okay with ending this meeting, it's really not going anywhere. You all are trying to browbeat me 

Darlene Green, Comptroller  41:04
Madam Mayor I'm available for a session meeting next week. . And I think we have to do what we have to do to move our city forward. move our city forward, if we have to have emergency contracts that we may need to keep the water running The president of the board has he's he's just let us know that he's not with us, with the board of estimate and apportionment. And I think that's a shame that he's operating strictly in his legislative role. In that role, he's decided to hold the city down that is a sad commentary for a man, that has tried to run for the mayor and failed and this is how he repays us. Yes, I said, You raised by the Mayor and you failed. And you have run each time since you've been the President of Board of Alderman and I assume you are tired of being the President of the board, when you run for Mayor. What can I say, I mean, you're acting like you don't want to do the job. Of course, you only want a role as a legislator. That's the job investment a portion of the border bottom, and you only choose to do one. That's that's a sad commentary. And I just don't know why you're acting like that. Again, I ask you your problem.  Comptroller why are you acting like that?  Why are you when all you can do is what you've done many times in the past and send the budget to the Board of Estimate and Apportionment, we would balance the budget and we would move the city forward. You decided that you're going to conjur up a new board bill to correct what you call a board bill that is not balanced. I'm just stunned that you want to run the Executive Branch from the Legislative Branch and that is a stunning development ,  that you are just telling us today. But at least we know what you're planning, we understand what you're doing.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  43:24
I understand what you do. The role of the people shows that we cannot violate state law by work in the past and every

Tishaura Jones, Mayor  43:33
president. We are not violating state law. Okay. The the the amount that you're talking about appeared after we passed the budget because the federal government took their the federal government took their detainees out let me finish. They took their detainees out. We did not know that that was going to happen. But I have sent sent you a letter that says how we're going to plug the revenue hole. We don't have to make cuts to the budget. We worked with Paul Payne, our budget directors we have trusted in the city for over 20 years to find the money to plug the revenue hole that's in the letter and I sent on on June 14, which was Monday. And if since we're talking about it, though, those amounts are 1.1 million and reduce detainee housing from fun 1010 out of department 633. We're adding 4.3 million in ground emergency medical transport revenues and an additional 300,000. From the American revenue recovery the American Recovery Act, which gives us the opportunity to use these funds to plug revenue holes.  We have $517 million to plug revenue holes and we are asking for an additional 300,000 to plug the the additional to the additional 17 million was in the budget that was passed on May 1. So this is something that came up. And you know, budgets aren't static documents, they ebb and they flow revenue comes and revenue goes.  And the federal government decided to remove their detainees from our facilities.  After may 1, we didn't know that was going to happen. And so we proposed ways to, to plug the revenue holes. Now since we have a plan, we would like to have the budget back and nobody is asking you to pass an unbalanced budget, once it comes back to na, we can plug the revenue holes, and then we will have a balanced budget. So and we also know and I'm not I'm not new to the rodeo, I'm new to this office. But I have watched this process in city government for many, many years. And I know that it is not unprecedented to ask for special meetings of the Board of Aldermen. And there are times when you can take away the rules, to to pass things through in a timely fashion things that have a time deadline, like the budget, like the spending of Direct Relief funds, all we are asking you to do is to help us move the city forward and take care of our 297,000 plus residents of the city who had most have elected us to these positions to look out for them, and hopefully do that by July 1.  And it's not an unprecedented acts to to to restrict the rules to move, move the rules. It's not an unprecedented act to have more meetings of the board of estimate apportionment to get the city's business done.  You know, we didn't know that the governor was going to also move us move the deadline forward to July 1, that was a surprise to us as well. And so we were trying to move as fast as we could and also appeal to the governor to try to reverse that decision. He did not so we have to move forward. And all that the Comptroller and are asking is that we take the necessary steps by suspending the rules and scheduling more meetings to wrap up the city's business by July 1.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  47:29
Okay, a couple things. Um, first thing is that, you know, I hear what you're saying, saying that, that the federal government said that they will no longer be sending detainees to the city of St. Louis.

Tishaura Jones, Mayor  47:47
We're hearing they decided to remove the detainees that they currently had in our prisons.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  47:52
The we we we are hearing the opposite. We were we heard that that that the city chose to in that and that's that's what was the max room. I'm sitting right here and telling you right now. But that's what was originally reported and originally recorded coming from your office now, since then, given the impact on the budget, the talking points have changed on us. And that's Okay. Now, here's here's the here's the here's the main thing to keep in mind. What would we help to get what what type of time savings or savings what we have by going through all the hoops that you and the comptroller are talking about versus what I've outlined, which means that this current budget, the budget that you guys wrote it on, will become law, July one. First day of July, midnight, midnight, when my home when it changes over that thing becomes becomes becomes the budget, right? 

Tishaura Jones, Mayor  49:01
All due respect that's passive- aggressive and we have given you a plan, we have given you a plan to plug the revenue hole.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  49:12
So here's what my commitment to you is to implement that plan and another board bill because why? why change everything. And to try to bring the Board of Aldermen back three or four more times to full sessions on the board while having an emergency meeting of the Board of E and A in the next week or so, and do all of this stuff. And to do it in a rough fashion. And again, I'm telling you right now as the bill sponsor, I'm not comfortable with making fly, just these a, you know, fly by night changes in this budget given the fact that revenue streams have been deleted from it, right. So we are going to take our time to make sure that We have a good solid budget in place. And we're going to make sure that we that next bill that we introduced to fix these issues within the budget is going to be one that that is comprehensive that takes into account all the different aspects and make sure that that budget is a sound budget.  So that's what we're going to do. 

Tishaura Jones, Mayor  50:19
Right? So we are in agreement that you're going to do nothing. 

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  50:25
No that's gonna take doing a lot. What I'm not going to do, what I'm not going to do is to allow what happened already, and I, and I'll be honest with you, I am it does not give me a lot of comfort that the other team members of the board and E and A, just look at this, like, it's no big deal, just get over it. Well, it was my name on it. I'm the head of the legislative branch of government. 

Tishaura Jones, Mayor  51:10
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Mister President  Who actually signs all of the bills 

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  51:16
I do

Tishaura Jones, Mayor  51:17
Ah--, the mayor. Exactly. So I'm giving you a plan. I am giving you a plan to plug the revenue holes, that I made our budget director,

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  51:30
we will use the plan. We will use the plan. 

Tishaura Jones, Mayor  51:33
Use the plan now. Why wouldnt you use the plan now? 

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  51:38
How about this, I want to do some I'll introduce a bill from the floor tomorrow. It doesn't include the things that the budget director is talking about. So why would that be a problem with you? Why would you have a problem with that? 

Tishaura Jones, Mayor  51:51
Will, that pass by July one. 

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  51:53
It doesn't happen.

Darlene Green, Comptroller  51:54
I have a problem with it, because it's not going to be a part of board bill one. Bill one. Was there a problem? I'm trying to give him my answer. Could you listen, please? Yes. Or bill? One is the board bill for the budget for the city of St. Louis. What you're saying is that you want to introduce a second bill in order to indicate a budget as well. Is that what I'm hearing from you? Then what then we're correcting board bill one with a second board bill indicate? I thought that meant two board bills board Bill one, plus the one that you just said that you were going to introduce tomorrow. Is that not to board bills? That's my question. Is it one point bill for the budget? Or is it two? please explain what you're saying that you would introduce tomorrow? Does it have to do with the budget at all?

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  53:02
What I would introduce tomorrow, if we have the information in time from the floor would be a supplemental appropriations bill that would take into account the current holes that we know are in the budget. But what also would charge Ways and Means with is doing a deep dive on a budget to make sure that no other revenue streams everything else that we voted on in NA is what is appropriate and is accounted for in the new board bill. The new board bill would not be a budget would not be would not take the place of the budget the current budget that both you ma'am comptroller union, they're voted out of boredom in a would would come into law day one, which is why I have no idea why we spent the last 45 minutes talking about that will that will come into effect. They want the bill that both of y'all y'all proposed. But you all both of you. It does again, make give me some pause and make me nervous that you're both of y'all seem to have a problem with me introducing a second bill. And given the board ample time to look at the changes because again, the bill goes in effect you I want the city has a budget to city but operations continue because they're budgeted whatever we bought voted on in that budget.

Tishaura Jones, Mayor  54:27
And like we have 8 million changes?  We have three, three changes, we have three changes. But let me ask you something while we're at it. Has there ever been a time? Has there ever been a time aside from last year that you have failed to send the budget back to E and A? before July one?

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  54:47
There's never been a time where we've had a revenue stream. 

Tishaura Jones, Mayor  54:51
No, no, no, no. That's not the answer. Again, besides last year, 

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  54:56
That's the answer. That's why we're having this whole discussion. You all, it's the elephant in the room  Madam comptroller.. [inaudible]

Darlene Green, Comptroller  55:07
There has never been a time that the board have

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  55:12
never been a time that we've put that a revenue stream.

Darlene Green, Comptroller  55:19
[inaudible] that for board from the Committee of ways means they sent it back. But the the president of the board failed to pass it on the floor. So he he's not admitting that he has has the has a history of not having the budget passed on the floor. That happened last year.  But that but that same budget that had come back to the Board of estimated apportionment, and there were estimates that were introduced to add and decrease that happened and that was the budget that was final pass. is president of the board did not place that budget on the floor for passage. It was in there for our own I guess you call it the informal calendar, which that was unprecedented.  But Madam Mayor, I'm saying from my experience, is that in the language that I use, here is what the people understand. He's handling us or he's handling you.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  56:29
You're taking us to our whole new [inaudible cross-talk]. I'm not going to allow you to do that.

Darlene Green, Comptroller  56:37
And that's what I don't understand, we have the current budget in front of us. Then, you're saying that you want to allow me to tell it like it is

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  56:49
[inaudible cross-talk]

Darlene Green, Comptroller  56:51
for the people in the back, please hear me? This is what this President of the Board and that's unprecedented. And I think it's sad and it's shameful because you didnt do this with Mayor Lyda Krewson and you didn't do it with Mayor Slay but you chose to do it now and this shameful and basically in our face and that's a shame, that's a shame.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  57:16
obviously, a comptroller has never seen a revenue stream removed from the budget, while the board or rather the Board of Aldermen and Ways and Means are deliberating on the budget and ways means just happen upon it through that know how to fix it. We are proposing today your proposed solution we're gonna put it in.

Darlene Green, Comptroller  57:44
You can send the budget back since you accepted the solution. You've accepted the solution creation and that's what I call handling kindliness. Madam comptroller, madam comptroller, I have a question for you. Yes, are there are these actions with these actions jeopardize our credit rating at all? Later in which the executive branch shall be run, that is a possibility that the board doesn't really hear one facet a bet he is going to handle the budget the way he wants to handle. Can we hear you loud and clear Mr. And I and they're the same issue. You're not even allowed here at the board of estimate appointment as to how it should be handled. You have just told us and I say look, this is what I'm gonna do.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  59:10
Here's what I'm telling you, man. One has my name on it. Madam comptroller. Madam Madam Mayor, how many have your name on all the ordinances? What is your name? on it, I have to vote on it. Not once, not twice, minimum or three times at the border wall but I have to deliberate on it. Then I have to sign it and then you put the final signature on everything else is God giving me

Tishaura Jones, Mayor  59:46
that opportunity? You're not giving me that opportunity? Or you're not giving me that opportunity? But Matt man, oh, man,

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  59:54
how old are you will have an opportunity.

Darlene Green, Comptroller  59:57
Motion I would like to move that the Board of estimate and apportionment would move that Ways and Means would send the budget back to the Board of estimate and a portion of that that's my motion

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:00:13
is nothing. It's

Darlene Green, Comptroller  1:00:14
okay. It's been moved in second. And I can tell you it's been moved and properly seconded

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:00:19
it's not coming back because it's still my business, 

Tishaura Jones, Mayor  1:00:21
Misses Green, Please call the roll. 

Stephanie Green, Clerk  1:00:24
Mayor Jones, 

Tishaura Jones, Mayor  1:00:25
aye. 

Stephanie Green, Clerk  1:00:27
comptroller green.

Darlene Green, Comptroller  1:00:29
Aye

Stephanie Green, Clerk  1:00:30
 president rate? 

Tishaura Jones, Mayor  1:00:36
Are you abstaining? Are you not voted essentially,

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:00:38
this isn't nothing motion, you don't have the power to do it. Do you all need to read the charter, you don't have the power to direct the executive branch of government. So the motion means nothing

Tishaura Jones, Mayor  1:00:51
I'm glad you talked about that, but you have the power to do certain things but you have the power to send the budget back. And this is not unprecedented. Anything that we're asking for is not unprecedented. I've been watching this process for years. And I think that it is possible for you to suspend the rules and to and to pass the budget and send it back. So we can amended with with it with the revenue that has been proposed in conjunction with our budget director. And like I said before, revenue ebbs and flows. And so revenue is not a static thing, it is a variable in the budget. And these are the variables, given the information that we have from previous years, which we don't know what's going to happen. We saw what happened in 2020, we had a global pandemic, which through our entire budget, out of balance for many, many months. And so we were able to do things at the end of the year to move money around in order to balance the budget for fiscal year 2021. So you are not giving me the opportunity, as the mayor, who has proposed the three things that will fix the revenue hole for this year, in order to pass board bill one and pass a balanced budget. We're not I'm not asking for anything that you haven't done before with previous mayor's

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:02:19
Oh, yeah, absolutely. You're actually off your ass. You're you. We we we had a budget that had revenue streams in it, a revenue stream was wiped out of it. And that information was not shared with the legislative branch of government. Me as the president of border wall and the person with his name on the bill. I shouldn't be more outraged. And I should have been very, very upset by that. But I what I what I just said, Well, I took it in stride and said, Let me send a letter over to the mayor's office so she can identify and

Tishaura Jones, Mayor  1:02:53
I sent you one  right back with us. But then you're not allowing us to, you're not allowing us to

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:02:56
allow me to finish allow me to fix. Now, what's being asked is that the Board of Aldermen has one more meeting next week. But somehow between now and then just start bringing the Board of Aldermen back in over and over and over and over again.

Tishaura Jones, Mayor  1:03:20
Suspend the rules and do everything your one meeting. I know how the process works. I come from the legislature. Well, do you remember,

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:03:27
I remember that, but but one of the things that you probably don't know about the Board of Aldermen is that we cannot do that. We cannot do everything in one meeting. We have to have the board bill read three separate times out loud on the floor of Board of Aldermen at three separate meetings. And those meetings have to be and that last meeting has to be spaced apart. And if there are changes in the bill that increases the timeline also. So what you're asking for, cannot be done. What we what what I am going to do I agree with with your recommendations and budget, what the budget what you're saying that to budget director help you put together. I will work with y'all on those things. We're gonna put them in a separate bill and we will introduce that bill to adjusted just that budget. But the budget as it stands the budget that both you all voted on, that's the thing that unfortunately, I I voted on it also. Yeah. And

Tishaura Jones, Mayor  1:04:33
the whole time that you're just trying to say Darlene and I were the only ones who voted on you know, the

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:04:39
risk. The reason I say both of you all because now both of you all seem to have just this harsh reactions to the bill that you voted on becoming law and then still being able to fix it. I don't get to fix it. 

Tishaura Jones, Mayor  1:04:54
You're not allowing us to fix it

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:04:56
I'm gunna introduce the bill  to fix it. 

Tishaura Jones, Mayor  1:05:00
All you have to do is ask the chairs of ways and means to pass the bill and send it back to E and A [inaudible] and then we'll be done. 

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:05:09
Can you explain to me that there is no difference? There is no difference. Only difference is yes, there is we can all get different sales for me,

Tishaura Jones, Mayor  1:05:18
you are creating more work for yourself and more work for the Board of Aldermen, that the solutions that you have on what you're proposing. I am sure that the board

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:05:28
president as the longest serving president of Board of Aldermen and history of the city of St. Louis, I understand this role backwards and forwards inside out. And I understand the role of the board of E&A, and I understand how much work it takes to do any of these things we're talking about. What I'm what I'm saying to you, Madam Mayor, is that what you're all talking about is a lot more work, but not just a lot more work. You also at the same time are asking me to take yet another leap of faith and hopes that everything else that are in it, because you send to the board, essentially the Board of Aldermen, you guys do not take any more time to do your due diligence on this thing. Oh, oh, look what we're saying. Because

Tishaura Jones, Mayor  1:06:23
we are I am saying, I am saying I am saying that. And I sent this letter to all of the people on the Ways and Means Committee, that these are the solutions, please send it back and we will plug in the budget hole and send it right back. That's all we're saying.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:06:41
We're not doing that. We're not doing that. We 

Tishaura Jones, Mayor  1:06:43
Okay, so you're gonna take the aggressive roll? okay

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:06:46
No, I'm gonna take the reality wrote, I was wrong on this guy's status on the reality. Now he wrote his bill that you both both for both of y'all further it will become law and you lost you I won doesn't the citizens will no services impacted, nothing's impacted by that. Now, we need to take time to identify any other changes that have to come into that budget, and move those through our supplemental appropriations bill, which is what we're gonna do.

Tishaura Jones, Mayor  1:07:24
What you are proposing is what usually happens during the year as we identify the changes in revenue, and the changes in expenses as we wait on a quarterly basis. When we get those reports from the budget director's office that says how much we spent and how much we still have left in those accounts. Then our department directors make decisions to move money either within the budget or they bring those changes to the Board of E and A. So what you are proposing already happens. I know the process to President Reed, and I know that this is simpler than what you are proposing.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:08:01
No, no, no, no, no. No. That's okay. That's okay. That is okay. Can we adjourn now? Madam comptroller, yes. Yes, ma'am.

Darlene Green, Comptroller  1:08:20
I agree with you. It's unfortunate that we have this problem with the president of the board, I'm hopeful that we can move forward in a manner more professional that he would understand that there's a new mayor here, and that you are actively trying to move the city forward. So I again, I think it would be my third time saying I am available for a special meeting. And next week, I do believe we will benefit. And I think that the Board of Aldermen perhaps can catch up with the board of estimate and apportionment. I'm not gonna we're not gonna leave the city behind. We're gonna move forward to present a board has pointed out where he may fall short, and introduce several meetings on his own time, as opposed to special meetings. But I think we need we owe it to our citizens to move as rapidly as we can to prevent some of those kinds of things that the summer is all about, which is, you know, our youth not having programming. We want the recreational programming to be available. The funds are available to us. The Board of Aldermen could be a good partner. I will stay hopeful that at some point that the prisoner of the board will change. But as we have it now, there's nothing we can do. So what do introduce I would say, may we adjourn. I will introduce that as a motion.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  1:10:07
Second. Thank you. Thank you Madam Comptroller and president. Have a good day.

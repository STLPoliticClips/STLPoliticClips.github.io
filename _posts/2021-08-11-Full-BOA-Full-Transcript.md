Sharon Tyus, 1st ward Alderwoman  02:39
just want to say I'm glad we're moving this forward. I'm kinda a little disappointed that a lot of the first word is not in this bill. But I intend for us to be included. Hope anybody didn't leave us out on purpose. But I am going to vote for this bill. And I still have some questions. I watched the board of the day. I have some questions, but I'm gonna vote for this bill.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  03:04
Thank you all the one Alderman from the twenty-third. Yes,

Joe Vaccaro, 23rd ward Alderman  03:09
I want to personally Anyway, you know, just this more of a point of personal preference. You know, I just want to say thanks for working for us that DNA that that I barely believe. And I truly believe that the majority of all of us work hard on making this what we believe to be the best bill possible. And I know you took a lot of heat from people saying this was something that it was about you when you're your job is defending us as a whole board, you represent us on DNA. So as a part of personal preference, I want to tell you, thank you for fighting for us at at na, and I do support this bill. All right. Thank

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  03:52
you all is but thank you all. Alderwoman from the 19th.

Marlene Davis, Alderwoman ward 19  03:59
Thank you, Mr. President and members of the board. This is very brief, and is so sincere. I just want to thank all of our colleagues for the hard work that was put into this bill. It is a bill that I saw evolved to what I consider to be the greatest effort put forward since I've been there in 14 years to make sure that the entire city and we all learned a lot from each other in those 12 hours. And I think we're prepared to move forward in a different way. And I think that all I can say is thank you to everyone. And most especially thank you, because again, you did take a lot of heat to support our vote because it was our vote that move that bill forward, a collective unified Board of Aldermen that did the right thing on behalf of the citizens of the city of St. Louis, and it cannot get any better than that and everybody needs to take ahead for that, and I'm sure as you move forward in your careers, this will be a moment that everyone will have on your resume for being a part of something that was truly, truly remarkable for this city. Thank you.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  05:17
Thank you. Thank you. Alderwoman Alderman from the twenty-second.

Jeffrey Boyd, 22nd ward Alderman  05:27
Thank you, Mr. President. I do see the hand of Alderwoman from the eighth No, no, she said that she didn't want to say anything.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  05:33
They took it. Okay, she took it down.

Joe Vaccaro, 23rd ward Alderman  05:36
Mr. President, I also want to thank you as well, for the for the awesome job, you did represent the Board of Aldermen. And I want to thank all my colleagues, for the hard work of support on this bill, I know the process may not have been the greatest. I definitely want to make sure moving forward, that it's even more inclusive of the Board of Aldermen and how we participate because one thing that I have learned over the past eight years have been alderman nobody knows their wards needs better than the alderman that represent those particular boards. And so the voice of each argument is paramount important to me on how we continue to move forward. We have $500 million that we're gonna spend over the next couple of years. And we certainly want to do it as right as possible. So again, I just want to thank everybody, I will be sending out some emails asking people for input Sony, may even schedule a hearing before we come back in September. Because I want to make sure we do it better than we did this first time, although I don't think we did it wrong. But I think we can always do legislation better. So again, I want to thank all my colleagues, I want to thank the mayor, I want to thank the console. I think this is an opportunity for everybody, you know, to hold their hand up saying we did this and do a victory lap collectively, because that's what it's all about. It's about a win win for our constituents. And so again, I just want to thank everybody for their hard work.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  07:10
All right, thank you. Alderwoman. From the eighth.

Annie Rice, 8th ward Alderwoman  07:13
Thank you, Mr. President, members, the board, it is good to see you all again. today.  I'm excited to pass out this immediate direct aid that our our citizens have been asking for and the the amount of money in here that is going to directly help people and their families as they're struggling as the we have the threat of the eviction or the end of the eviction moratorium. And thankfully, we stayed for a little bit, but we have time to get that money out to people who need it. We have vaccination, mobile vaccination clinics, we've got all sorts of incredible direct cash relief, that is getting out. And I'm thrilled about that. And thrilled to watch the, you know, the $500 cash payments get out. I'm so just want to thank everybody for for that work. I I was a bit frustrated on our last meeting. I know it was 10 hours long. And but there were some other amendments that we were really hoping to discuss in front of the full board. And you know that I think it was a missed opportunity to have that discussion as as full board members about where were we we really came together on some of those things, and maybe where we still continue to differ. I also remain concerned about the the Treasury and the possibility of provoking an audit or a clawback. We do have incredible infrastructure money coming down with the senate passing the infrastructure bill and the bill back better grants. I think there's a lot of money coming down the pike, that is going to be going specifically for economic development. I'm thrilled about all of those things. I think the city of St. Louis, and our citizens have a real I mean, real promise on the horizon. And if we use this money correctly, we get this money to the people to use correctly. And so I remain concerned, I think the the points in a meeting have given me a significant pause about each element of this bill. And I, I worry a little bit about, about the precedent that we're setting. If we've, if we've been told no, but we're going ahead. So I think I think like I said, I'm excited to see more development money coming down the pike. And and hopefully we can, we can use that in a way to address the concerns of long neglected and intentionally neglected neighborhoods, in our city.  So thank you all so much for all of your dedicated work for everyone who was able to be gone for those those 12 hours. You know, it really shows how much we all deeply care about the city and our residents. So I'm looking forward to hopefully having maybe less hours of debate on the next rounds of bills as we come forward. But it's all good work. And it is really important as we're we're talking about uh, you know, trends This formative amount of money for the city of St. Louis. So thank you all so much.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  10:05
Alderwoman from the 15th. Thank you, Mr.

Dr. Megan Green, 15th ward Alderwoman  10:09
President, members of the board, I'll keep it brief. I think we belaboured a lot of our points in our marathon meeting a couple of weeks ago, I'm excited for a lot of the pieces of this this bill, I'm really excited for the $500 Direct Relief payments. I know a lot of folks in our city are they're counting on these. Getting out getting to folks who are really hurting right now they're counting on this, this rental, and mortgage money getting out. We're very thankful that the eviction moratorium was extended, because we know just the number of evictions that have been pre filed or filed in court already is pretty concerning. And we do need the time and the infrastructure to build up our housing services or homeless services. And so I think this is a really great start in in building that resiliency into our systems. The Delta variant, as we all know, is gaining traction throughout our city, our numbers are, are rising quickly, and we still have not hit the 70% vaccination rates that we need to hit. And this is a really great, I think, building of infrastructure, public health infrastructure in order to get those shots in arms. And I really hope that after this meeting, each and every one of us is going out there using our platforms as elected officials to help, you know, decrease vaccine hesitancy make sure that we're getting those those shots in arms, making sure folks know where all of these vaccine events are. So that we can get those numbers up and hopefully, get our get the handle on this delta variant before it, it continues to increase. You know, I did listen to the NA meeting last week, I do have some concerns, based upon the testimony of Jim Brown. I know I do think he brings a lot of expertise having served under seven different mayor's and I do have concerns about an audit or having to pay back funds in the future if if these funds are not appropriated correctly. And so I think, you know, we really, you know, have to rely on the mayor's office to do the right thing. And and make sure that these funds are put in a way are used in a way that are in line with Treasury guidelines, and that we follow Treasury guidelines. And recognize that in the future, we do have it looks like some transportation money that's or infrastructure money that's going to be coming down, that can help build some of these, you know, development infrastructure in the in the process. So I think there's never a perfect bill that comes through the board. This isn't a perfect bill. There's some great things in it. There's some things that give me pause in it. But But all in all, you know, we are getting some Direct Relief payments to folks, we are getting some shots in arms, we are getting some funds to community violence, prevention, all things that are very important into our community. And so I'm excited for those investments coming down the pipeline pretty quickly.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  13:33
Alderman from the seventh

Jack Coatar, 7th ward Alderman  13:38
Thank you, Mr. President, members of the board. I'm glad that people have put their disagreements aside and that we're gonna stop playing politics and finally pass this direct aid in board bill two, anyone who's who's been downtown and seen some of the encampments, you know, knows that the kind of crisis we're facing, and then the relief that's desperately needed for our unhousedand for others. So I'm glad we're doing this. There's obviously still a lot of money that needs to be appropriated in this first tranche that we've received from Treasury.  And it's my hope that this process, you know, room 200, in the mayor's office is realized, you know, we've got to be part of this process.  I'm all for all the public engagement in the world set up citizen committees take their input, but you've got to include the board, you got to include board members, and your spending plans because frankly, at the end of the day, it's got to come through this body and it's got to be appropriated by us. And I think a lot of this could be avoided with some better communication and including board members in what the administration's goals are, and comparing those to what we would like to accomplish as a body and blend those together, which I think we've done here, but it was messy. I'm hopefully going down down the road we don't take quite this long to appropriate funds and and can work together and get this money out to help people. Thank you.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  14:58
Alright, thank you, alderman from The 23rd

Joe Vaccaro, 23rd ward Alderman  15:01
Yes, just just real very quickly talking about shots in arms. If you have someone that is homebound the--- if you call the health department, I went through this with the fire chief Dennis Dickerson, they will go to homebound people's home and give them their shot in their house. So if you have some homebound you call the health department. And they have the fire department and the EMS or the paramedics go out, and they're actually doing shots for homebound. So I was unaware of it. Someone asked me if they could get a shot in their house. They call the fire chief? And he said yes. [cuts out] the process.  All right. Thank

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  15:42
you. Thank you. Thank you all. Alderwoman from the 17th.

15:52
Thank you, Mr. President, members of board to say, acknowledge to all of us as older people. I think you work really hard and work really well to get this bill passed. And I'm glad that you know we're going to be able to give directly to individuals and other other items in terms of just COVID and helping people. No and at the same time, I doubt that. We haven't been in agreement some things. But overall, we have made this work. So I just wanted to make that as well.

Lewis Reed, President Board of Alderman  16:33

I just want to thank everyone for, for getting this bill done. You know, as usual, especially when you're dealing with large funding bills, or politics that swirl around at night, I'm so appreciative of the board waltman for being able to set that stuff besides coming together for the cause. Also will tell you, under I think a section 3.8 there are five funding tools that our PR funds can come under, take a look at loss revenue section, because the particular section that's been up for debate is under loss revenue. And I will send out to everyone, the National Association of Counties, what they say about the use of loss revenue, so, so again, thank you to everyone. I am just appreciative that everybody here came together for the cause we're going to get money out to places that need it all across town. And we are going to address some of the issues of the on house rental assistance, mortgage assistance, utility assistance, and all those things. But thank you so much, again, for getting that done. All of the business being sweaty prides itself on open session fixes signature here to today and that these may become low. Even though we've done announcements, I'm going to still allow some announcements. But before we do that, we have like everyone that joined me in a moment of silence for the loss of a couple friends. You know, john john Watson Jr, who does the opening prayer for us nearly every Friday. His his mother, missionary, Addy Watson, she was 84 she passed away just recently, I had an opportunity to go to the house and sit with her before her passing. And I don't know if you know if if some of you who have been here for a while if you remember when she came and open up our meetings, and just a powerful, powerful, soulful, spiritual voice. And she is just amazing. She came in saying when, when john Watson retired, and we gave him a resolution for his retirement, we will be sending the resolution around and I would love it if we can get all alderman to join in on that resolution for john and his family. We are just going to really, really miss miss her. Denise's father, john mccain passed, passed suddenly also while we were out on break, so please join me in a moment of silence for them to Alderwoman from the twenty-sixth yet some something else to add today. Okay. Is there anyone else that we should add to that to those two? Right, please join me in a moment of silence. Thank you all for that. Any further announcements, any further announcements? All the ones from the 26th.

Shameem Clark-Hubbard, 26th ward Alderwoman 26  24:21

Board my colleagues, I just wanted to take opportunity to send some love light hugs prayers out the mother of students that are going back to school within the next couple of weeks before we will be and I'm a mother of five, you know, my children are assigned to public school.

So for all of you that have my most public schools, and your dish, I'm sorry, and your boards. And if you have the opportunity go by, of course social distancing wave, say hi, let the children know that we welcome them back that we support them and see In the SAS, as we have, you know, our district is dealing with some challenges, but I know I'm preaching to the choir when I say we support them.

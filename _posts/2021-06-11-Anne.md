Anne Schweitzer, Alderwoman ward 13: Thank you so much, Mr. President, members of the board. I-- you know, I've been looking through Rockridge Capital's website while we've been talking and you know, I'm pretty impressed by the organization that they have. 

I'm looking at the different funds.. They have seven different funds that they're using to invest in hotels. It looks like they've put, you know, millions and millions and millions and you know, into these hotels. The fund size goes up to a billion dollars and their funds, the capitalization is at over 5 billion. So it looks to me like these people have some money. 

And I'm really in favor of investment in our neighborhoods and downtown. But not as much in favor of property tax abatements, especially when there's already one happening here. I am a no on this resolution because of the fact that I'm just not seeing financial need from this company, from what they're putting out about themselves. And, you know, I don't think that there isn't a solution here or some sort of compromise. But as the resolution stands, I am a No, thank you.

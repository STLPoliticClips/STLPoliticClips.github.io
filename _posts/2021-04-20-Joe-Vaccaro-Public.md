Joe Vaccaro, Alderman 23rd Ward: I don't know that I would agree that every resolution would require, ya know, cause we do courtesy resolutions. And then public testimony at every meeting and then every meeting will go for hours on end. It’s not always necessary on some of the things we do. 

It’s always been up to the chairman to make that decision and sometimes, we’ll have public testimony at one or two meetings, when it’s all on the same subject and then to come back and say gee well we’re gunna keep doing that, over and over and over and it seems to always be the same organized group that is doing that. 

I don't see this as, I think at that point, you’re taking the power and privilege away from the chairman to look into whether or not at some point to cut that off. I mean, it seems to me that the ones that we've had, even though it’s on the same subject, it’s been ya cant have public testimony over and over and over and over, it just doesn't seem right,

It’s always, and I know they like to get on me on Facebook going oh well I didn't do this or I didn't do that but again, it’s always the same organized group and it’s endless. And it's the same thing over and over. We don't generally even hold people to the three minutes that we say, when we've done public testimony we’ve kind of opened it up and let people talk for a bit longer. 

I think this is a change that I just can't get my head around to change it. I can't support this just so you know.

Joe Vollmer, Alderman ward 10: You can't just make people clap and go home and sleep at night and say I did a good thing. You can’t impassionately plead “we’re not giving them a raise, they’re earning their money!” Hell, I earned my money everyday. I’ve been it since I was a kid. I didn’t go to school, college. My parents couldn’t afford it. 

Hell, I used to carry dead bodies at a funeral home for my father. I’ve done everything there is to make a dime. I saved and I saved, my wife is working now for me so I can stand here and tell you how idiotic I think this is. 

So, with that, I could talk for the rest of the night because the bar’s open until 2 and I dont have to go back to close it until then. Since you called me away from happy hour, we can sit here and discuss anything you’d like to discuss. My new love for the Alderman from the 21st, we could talk about that for hours. 

I was told we went to the same high school, but apparently had different teachers. But now I believe we learned the same thing there.

This is the City of St. Louis, this is not San Francisco, it’s not New York, it’s not Seattle, you are living in a very small, a city that is getting smaller, and will be getting smaller based upon your vote today, if you vote in the affirmative.

This is a very impassioned plea for you to send this down. You are going to hurt many, many, people. While you think you are helping, you are not helping.

Jeffrey Boyd, Alderman ward 22: Some people, you wanna say, aerial surveillance is militarizing the police. I sometimes think you guys don’t give a damn about the police. The police get criticized more often for trying to do their freakin’ jobs than they get celebrated. 

I hear people say they’re over policed, they’re over policed, that is ridiculous. It sounds sexy, it sounds good. They’re overpolicing us? No they're not. The people I hear from say they're are not enough police officers in our neighborhoods.

We continue to hear from the Police department we are down 135 officers, we’re down 105 officers, we’re down so many officers, we hear it over and over again. But somehow, we’re being overpoliced? 

I wonder if subconsciously, we’re telling the criminals it’s okay.

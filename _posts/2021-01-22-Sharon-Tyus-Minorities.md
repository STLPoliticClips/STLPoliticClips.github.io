Sharon Tyus, Alderwoman ward 1: I had a Zoom meeting last night in one of my neighborhood. The first thing that was asked was ‘Alderwoman, you’re not for spy stuff’? No, Im not for it. We went through it, we didn’t just name it the Spy thing, we actually went through it and talked about what people’s concerns are.

What we have is an older generation that is very aware of police spying on Black people. Black Panthers, I’m gonna use them, we can get rid of the Black Panthers who had programs that fed people. We still use the Black Panthers program about feeding people and WIC and things. 

They were targeted as an enemy combatant, but the KKK and all these white supremacists-- about two weeks they were on the Capitol steps -- I’m sorry, no they weren't, they were inside our Capitol. -- Now, if that were Black people, we’d have been on the stairs dead.
